FIRST ON FOX Environmental groups that have been vocal about climate change were silent when asked about Vice President Kamala Harris campaign dropping nearly 7 million on private jet flights since July. Harris spent nearly 4 million on private flights in just six weeks starting in July, after calling on Americans to change their habits to curb climate change, a previous Fox News Digital review found.The latest review of new filings with the Federal Election Commission reveals that Harris spent an additional 3.1 million on private planes in September alone. Fox News Digital asked environmental groups, several which have protested private jet use, about Harris private flights but did not receive a response from any of them. The groups included Sunrise Movement, the Center for Biological Diversity, Greenpeace, Earth Island Institute, Earth Justice, Naturefriends International, and International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Thats practical. The 2024 presidential campaign is not the first time Harris has used private jets to hit the campaign trail.

Vice President Kamala Harris is facing criticism for touting oil production under the Biden administration after becoming the Democratic nominee, while previously calling for such companies to pay the price for climate change. During her 2019 presidential bid, Harris told voters that she was in favor of the Department of Justice investigating oil companies, such as Chevron and Shell, for profiting off pollution. These big oil companies, these fossil fuel companies, look, you should be really prepared to look at a serious fine or be charged with a crime. Because heres the thing, these big oil companies and these fossil fuel companies have been making so much money and profiting off of this pollution, Harris said. Yet, after becoming the Democratic nominee, the vice president began touting the largest increase in domestic oil production in history under the BidenHarris administration.

In 2024, voters in multiple states will decide on key ballot initiatives that will shape their climate and environmental policies for the next several years. Washington residents face a particularly important decision on whether to repeal the states major climate policy, the Climate Commitment Act, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 95 below 1990 levels by 2050.The measure, dubbed Washington Initiative 2117, would repeal the 2021 law and prohibit state agencies from implementing any carbon capandtrade system. Proponents of the bill have heavily criticized the law and claim the current carbon tax has increased energy costs. HARRIS DROPS MILLIONS ON PRIVATE JET SPENDING DESPITE CALLING CLIMATE CHANGE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT A woman drops off her ballot ahead of the primary election, on March 4, 2024, at the Los Angeles County Registrar in Norwalk, California. Frederic J. BrownGetty Images Lets Go Washington, a political action committee PAC endorsing the measure, suggested that if the bill passes, voters will save on gas, groceries and on energy bills.We are urging all Washington residents to vote yes, pay less on 2117 to finally hold Gov. Jay Inslees administration accountable for their arrogant and reckless policymaking, Brian Heywood, Lets Go Washington founder, told Fox News Digital in a statement. The Climate Commitment Act is a deeply flawed and broken program thats taken billions of dollars off the backs of everyday Washingtonians while doing nothing to reduce carbon emissions. A group opposing the bill, however, tells Fox News Digital that passing the measure would mean more pollution in our air and water.LAWSUIT ACCUSES STATE DEPARTMENT, DOJ OF STONEWALLING FOIA REQUESTS REGARDING CLIMATE OFFICE PERSONNEL I2117 is a deceptive initiative opposed by more than 500 organizations across Washington, including small businesses and major employers, firefighters, doctors and nurses, the majority of federally recognized Tribal Nations in Washington state, because it would threaten our health and devastate investments in transportation, said Kelsey Nyland, a spokesperson for the No 2117, a coalition campaigning against the measure. By forcing 5.4 billion in cuts to our states transportation funding, it would hurt every corner of our state, putting major road and bridge projects addressing congestion, safety and freight mobility at risk of being delayed or even canceled. Wind and solar panels merge in a desert alternative energy site in Mojave, California. Joe SohmGetty Images California voters will also see a climate initiative on their ballots this fall. If passed, Proposition 4 would create a 10 billion taxpayerfunded bond to finance climate projects in the state. Some of these include improving drinking water across the state, wildfire prevention efforts, and protecting coastal areas from sea level rise.Opponents of the ballot measure call it too pricey, suggesting that there would be financial implications to passing it. Prop 4 is a Democrat political wishlist disguised as socalled climate action, saddling taxpayers with nearly 20 billion in Wall Street debt. Rather than funding lasting infrastructure, it funnels money into pet projects like popup tents for farmers markets and zoo exhibits  far from the meaningful solutions Californians need, Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones told Fox News Digital in a statement. Dont be fooled by claims of progress Prop 4 wont address any of the major issues facing our state, but will leave taxpayers bearing the cost of yet another massive loan.The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association HJTA also said the state should not take a loanbased approach to climaterelated mitigation.

Bob Riha Jr.Getty ImagesClean water and fire mitigation are important priorities that should be funded in the budget, first, not last. Proposition 4 instead borrows 10 billion, which has to be repaid with interest. This is the most expensive way to pay for anything. Prop. 4 also funds billions of dollars of vague grants and programs, and these should never be paid for with borrowed money, a spokesperson for HJTA told Fox. Other states will vote on environmental initiatives this cycle. Question 4 on Rhode Islands ballot will decide on a 53million bond for land preservation in the state, while Amendment 1 in Minnesota seeks to earmark funds from the state lottery to the Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund ENRTF for environmental projects.

About 54 of land in the 48 contiguous US states is affected by droughts.Even as the country experiences autumn and heads further away from a summer of record heat, the droughts continue to rise. More than 150 million people in the country  and 149.8 million in the 48 contiguous states  are in a drought this week. That is about a 34 increase since last week and an over 150 increase since last month.The drought is also affecting more than 318m acres of crops, a 57 increase since last month, according to the tracker.That reality is only the latest illustration of global warming and the climate crisis, spurred primarily by humans burning of fossil fuels.Weather tracker Zero rain and unseasonable heat cause flash droughts in USRead moreLast month, it was reported that worlds water cycle was out of balance for the first time in human history. Nearly 3 billion people face water scarcity.Drought conditions are not simply caused by a decrease in rain  but are driven and exacerbated by abnormally high temperatures that can quickly suck moisture from the atmosphere and the earth.The problem, however, is more complicated than simply counting rainy days. Droughts can occur even when there is slightly more rain than usual, depending on the frequency of rainfall. If there is a lot of rain all at once, its difficult for the water to be properly absorbed into the ground.Climate change can cause extremes in both directions, Dr Lifeng Luo, a professor of environmental science at Michigan State University, said. When it rains really hard, its not going to really penetrate into the soil. It becomes runoff, which produces floods.Different city and state leaders across the US have acknowledged the drought issue and have tried various ways of beginning to address it. In New York City, the mayor, Eric Adams, encouraged residents to water their lawns less frequently and to only flush when necessary.Taking shorter showers means more water could be allocated for other purposes, which is good, Luo said. But its impacts in terms of reversing a drought is very small.According to the National Integrated Drought Information System, droughts will increase an areas reliance on groundwater. Groundwater provides more than 40 of the water used for US agriculture and domestic water supplies. Increased pumping during droughts can reduce the future availability of those supplies.Climate warning as worlds rivers dry up at fastest rate for 30 yearsRead moreCalifornia, which relies heavily on the agricultural industry to support its economy, lost 1.7bn in crop revenue in 2022 due to the ongoing drought.Dry conditions can also result in low water levels on rivers and other waterways. Ports and other waterborne transportation may become limited due to a reduction in available routes and cargocarrying capacity, which increases transportation costs.That cost increase is ultimately transferred to consumers, who see it in the form of higherpriced products, groceries and other commodities.Droughts affect water resources, agriculture, transportation, which can overall impact the economy, Luo said. To have a broad relief, we need regular precipitation, and theres no simple answer to getting that.Explore more on these topicsUS newsDroughtClimate crisisPuerto RicoUS weatherWaternewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionGreen lightNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints  correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms  conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top 2024 Guardian News  Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph Scott OlsonGetty ImagesUS elections 2024Activists fear Florida enshrining right to fish and hunt will lead to trophy huntingCritics say amendment 2 is intentionally open to applying chicanery and outdated hunting practicesRichard Luscombe in MiamiThu 7 Nov 2024 12.34 ESTLast modified on Fri 8 Nov 2024 13.29 ESTShareBlack bears in Florida could soon again be in the crosshairs of trophy hunters after a controversial wildlife ballot measure was approved by voters, environmental advocates say.The fear stems from amendment 2, which enshrines into the state constitution legal protections for citizens right to hunt and fish.The law, critics say, was written deliberately vaguely in order to present it as a conservation measure instead of a vehicle they claim will speed the rolling back of environmental protections and open a pathway to future legislation permitting inhumane measures such as steeljawed traps and hunting with dogs.Bear hunting has been banned in Florida since 1994, except for a limited single season in 2015, and while the amendment does not specifically reintroduce it, activists say it is a significant step on the way.Earlier this year, state legislators passed a law allowing the shooting and killing of black bears in selfdefense, with opponents at the time pointing out it could be abused, especially in rural areas, by landowners simply wanting to eliminate what they saw as nuisance animals.The runup to Tuesdays election saw a cascade of TV commercials and other media attention in Florida dedicated to more prominent ballot measures such as a protection of abortion rights and the legalization of recreational marijuana. Both failed.The approval of amendment 2 is disappointing, as it suggests that many voters may not have been fully informed about the implications of this measure, said Kate MacFall, Florida state director for the Humane Society of the US.Unfortunately, our states constitution now includes language that could lead to attempts to legalize outdated, cruel and harmful practices, such as the trophy hunting of black bears, trapping, snaring and baiting  activities that most Floridians neither participate in nor support.She said the amendment that establishes hunting as the preferred means of wildlife management in Florida ignored the availability of proven, nonlethal conflictprevention measures.Efforts by the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission FWC to pass essential wildlife protections affecting hunting and fishing could also be compromised, she added.Scientists and conservationists warned ahead of election day that the language of the amendment, specifically a vague reference to traditional methods as the preferred form of legalized hunting, could supersede sciencebased wildlife management.That language is open to applying chicanery, David Guest, a retired Earthjustice lawyer based in Florida, told the Guardian.Does that mean that you can use explosives in the destructive practice called blast fishing? I mean, what in the world is this?There is no legal or other definition of traditional methods in the subsequent language of the amendment, Guest said, leaving its interpretation wide open.Opponents say that vagueness could enable worstcase possibilities such as the use of steeljaw leghold traps, which are considered cruel and illegal in more than 100 countries using hounds to hunt bears and other game, which is banned or restricted in several states and more relaxed killing limits.Hot queen conch seeks cool mates Floridas new speed dating service to save endangered shellfishRead moreMeanwhile, a Florida Bar analysis suggested that organized hunts are likely to become more common.The amendment received 67 support, far surpassing the 60 needed. With its passage, Florida became the 24th state, and last in the southeast, to add hunting and fishing as a constitutional right.Conservativeleaning groups such as the National Rifle Association and Congressional Sportsmens Foundation are behind a number of similar sportsmens bills of rights measures across the country. They view hunting as a cultural tradition, and legislation they sponsor is intended to counter proposals to limit hunting and fishing.Despite this discouraging result, the Humane Society of the US will continue to fight to protect Floridas wildlife from these cruel practices at all levels, MacFall said.Explore more on these topicsUS elections 2024FloridaWildlifeConservationUS politicsAnimalsHuntingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUSUS elections 2024WorldEnvironmentUkraineSoccerBusinessTechScienceNewslettersWellnessNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints  correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms  conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top 2024 Guardian News  Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Cop officials also introduced the fake investor to a senior executive at the national oil and gas company Socar to discuss investment opportunities.What would a good outcome at Cop29 look like?Read moreSoltanov told the fake investment group I would be happy to create a contact between your team and their team Socar so that they can start discussions. Shortly after that they received an email from Socar.The UN framework convention on climate change UNFCCC, the UN body that oversees Cop, says officials should not use their roles to seek private gain and it expects them to act without selfinterest.On the recording, Soltanov tells the fake oil and gas group There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established. Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.He then described natural gas as a transitional fuel, adding We will have a certain amount of oil and natural gas being produced, perhaps for ever. At Cop28 last year, the countries involved agreed to transition away from fossil fuels, and the UN body the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is clear that developing new oil and gas fields is incompatible with climate goals signed up to in the Paris agreement.The Cop29 team also appeared willing to waive climate requirements for the company if it sponsored the event. Cop event sponsors are supposed to commit to cutting their emissions and are expected to sign a national pledge, promising to come up with a credible net zero transition plan at some point over the next two years.However, during the negotiations, these requirements were waived and a new clause was added to give the fake investment group meeting opportunities with key local stakeholders from the energy sector at Cop29.There was a similar scandal at the Cop28 talks last year in the UAE when leaked documents revealed the host planned to use climate meetings with other countries to promote deals for its national oil and gas companies. The talks were chaired by Sultan Al Jaber, the chief executive of the national oil company Adnoc and the UAEs climate envoy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planets most important stories.

They offer highly granular and robust data with excellent geographic and temporal coverage. With the consequences of climate change gradually becoming more apparent, adding the most recent data makes our estimates much more robust.Despite the increase in risk to global economies, some experts say the analysis is a huge understatement of the impact climate breakdown will wreak on economic growth.Sandy Trust, an actuary who works on sustainability and the climate crisis, said the small print in the report by the network of central banks revealed they had failed to take in to account the impact of climate tipping points, sea temperature rises, migration and conflict as a result of global heating, human health impacts or biodiversity loss. Climate tipping points, for example the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, and the deforestation of the Amazon, are critical thresholds that, if crossed, will lead to huge, accelerating and sometimes irreversible changes in the climate system.View image in fullscreenClimate tipping points, for example the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, are critical thresholds that, if crossed, will lead to huge changes in the climate system. Photograph Luis LeamusAlamyTrust said This is a massive onethird hit from physical damage on GDP. It has increased more than five times, from about 6 to 33.But while this is a much more severe damage risk, it is by no means comprehensive. The analogy I would use is a model of the Titanic where you can see the iceberg, but the modelling fails to recognise that there are not enough lifeboats on board, or that the cold water is a threat to human life. So this report is still systemically underestimating the risk.The NGFS is a group of global banks that provide environmental and climate risk modelling in the financial sector. Its update on climate risks using the new methodology foresees more than 30 losses due to the climate crisis by 2100 from a 3C rise in global average surface temperatures. The report said The new damage function does a much better job than its predecessor at representing the physical risks posed by climate change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planets most important stories.

It cannot be excluded that the economic effects of climate change might turn out to be even more severe than visualised under the NGFS scenarios, for instance, if certain tipping points are reached, the report said.Thus, users should also take into account the tail risks of climate change, along with other risks such as naturerelated ones, which are not necessarily captured by these scenarios.Trust wrote a report last year with the University of Exeter, which said widely available climate crisis scenarios systematically underestimated the risks, and he said underestimating the impact of global heating was extremely dangerous.Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyEconomicsEconomic growth GDPUS economic growth and recessionClimate crisisFinancial sectornewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyFrom higher tariffs to lower taxes, will Donald Trumps economic plan pay off?19h agoVon der Leyens Cop29 absence sends fatal signal, say watchers3d agoMore tariffs, less red tape what Trump will mean for key global industries2d agoEU emissions fall by 8 in steep reduction reminiscent of Covid shutdown31 Oct 2024Sliver of cool surface water 2mm deep helps oceans absorb CO2, say scientists25 Oct 2024German carmakers shares slump on fear Trump will impose steep tariffs3d agoWe have emotions too Climate scientists respond to attacks on objectivity25 Oct 2024Trump or Harris?

The lawsuit came two years after a recordshattering heat dome killed 69 people across the county.Research shows the climate crisis greatly exacerbated the 2021 temperature surge. Oil and gas companies, which fuel global warming, should pay climate damages, the lawsuit argues.On Monday, the county announced that it has amended its complaint to include the gas utility NW Natural, Oregons oldest and largest fossil fuel company.NW Natural engaged in an enterprise of misrepresentation about the effects its products would have on the climate, the amended litigation says.NW Natural is responsible for some 9 of Oregons carbon dioxide emissions, the lawsuit alleges, arguing that it has also disseminated misinformation about the climate dangers of gas.Gas is primarily made of methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more planetheating than carbon dioxide.Big oil faces a rising number of climatefocused lawsuits, report findsRead moreThe countys move could open the door for more litigation against utilities, said Alyssa Johl, vicepresident of legal and general counsel at the Center for Climate Integrity, which tracks and supports climate deception lawsuits.Gas utilities have been significant players in the historic and ongoing deception campaigns to mislead the public about the dangers of fossil fuels, she said.Though NW Natural has touted its commitment to a carbon neutral future, the company has not implemented any operational changes that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Oregon, the lawsuit says. It also accuses the company of astroturfing community support for gas.NW Natural declined to comment, saying it had not yet reviewed the suit.Last month, a ProPublica investigation found that, despite public claims to be lowering its emissions, NW Natural has made little effort to achieve that goal.Lawmakers and advocates have for years urged the states department of justice to investigate the utility for false advertising.The amended complaint also names the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine  a nonprofit that environmentalists have long said spreads climate denial  marking the first such suit against the group.The original complaint was also the first to target the multinational consulting firm McKinsey  Company, which has long worked with big oil.Multnomah county is one of two dozen cities, counties and states across the US that have filed charges of climate deception against the fossil fuel industry. It seeks 50bn in damages from the 2021 heat dome and additional 1.5bn for future climate damages.Were already paying dearly in Multnomah County for our climate crisis  with our tax dollars, with our health and with our lives, the county chair, Jessica Vega, Pederson said in a statement. Going forward we have to strengthen our safety net just to keep people safe.Explore more on these topicsOregonBig oil uncoveredOil and gas companiesFossil fuelsOilCommoditiesLaw USClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionGreen lightNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints  correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms  conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top 2024 Guardian News  Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Image credit Johnny Johnson via Getty Images In the fight against climate change scientists have invented some weird and wonderful ways to cut greenhouse gases, stop glacier melt and shade the powerful rays of the sun to reduce the planets surface temperature. The future of Earth relies on humankinds ability to curb our reliance on fossil fuels  and ultimately use fewer natural resources.Here are 32 of the weirdest ways scientists have suggested to combat climate change.Artificial volcanoesImage credit Henryk Welle via Getty ImagesTo slow global warming, scientists have proposed creating artificial volcanoes to form an enormous heat shield that reduces Earths temperature. The Pinatubo strategy involves launching jets into the stratosphere that release sulfur compounds, which reflect sunlight away from the Earth  mimicking the natural impact on the atmosphere as a volcanic eruption. In 2011, as part of the threeyear Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering SPICE project, scientists from the U.K. used a giant pipe and balloon in a field experiment that injected particles into the stratosphere to generate cooling.Wrap Greenland in a reflective blanketImage credit Paul Souders via Getty ImagesScientists have explored wrapping Greenland in a massive, reflective blanket to slow the rate of glacier melt. In 2009, climate scientist Ken Caldeira at the Carnegie Institution for Science suggested that reflecting sunlight away from various regions  mostly in the Arctic  could reduce the warming effect and glacier melt. In the Discovery series Ways To Save The Planet which aired in 2009, scientists led by glaciologist Jason Box use reflective, white polypropylene blankets to cover glaciers and test the theory.Feed livestock garlicImage credit Catherine Falls Commercial via Getty ImagesLivestock is the worlds largest producer of methane  a hazardous greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and more than 1 million premature human deaths annually. Reducing agriculturerelated methane emissions, which are caused by the release of gas by farting and burping, is key to fighting climate change, according to a report by the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP and Climate and Clean Air Coalition. Scientists have found that feeding livestock garlic, which contains bioactive organosulfur compounds, cuts methane emissions and produces health benefits for consumers of meat and dairy products from the livestock.Artificial trees that remove CO2 from the airImage credit Arizona State UniversityPlanting forests of artificial trees that contain layers of carbon dioxideabsorbing discs could fight climate change on a global scale, according to scientists from Arizona State University ASU. The mechanical trees use carboncapture technology, and can reportedly capture CO2 a thousand times quicker than natural trees. Developed by Klaus Lackner, physicist and director of Center of Negative Carbon Emissions, the first mechanical tree was installed on the ASU campus in 2022.Forcefeed plankton bloomsImage credit PawelG Photo via Getty ImagesPhytoplankton, a microscopic plant that floats in the ocean, provides food for marine life, produces oxygen, absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen into the air. Pollution from agriculture and industry can cause huge blooms of plankton to form. Scientists hope that by fertilizing the deep ocean with iron, they can cause huge swathes of plankton to bloom and absorb extra CO2. This method was reported by The Times in 2019 but remains a controversial approach to fighting climate change.Fake whale poopImage credit izanbar via Getty ImagesScientists want to increase the volume of greenhouse gas emissions that the ocean captures by creating artificial whale feces using ironrich sand or volcanic ash. Whales naturally defecate ironrich poop on the oceans surface that causes huge blooms of phytoplankton to form, which feed fish and capture carbon. Professor Sir David King, chair of Cambridge Universitys Centre for Climate Repair and lead of the fake excrement project, hopes that these plankton blooms could capture 50 of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions.Giant snow cannons to blast glaciersImage credit David Merron Photography via Getty ImagesLive Science previously reported an unusual solution to prevent Antarcticas western ice sheet from collapsing massive snow cannons. These cannons pump seawater to create trillions of tons of artificial snow to blast across glaciers. According to a 2019 study published in the journal Science, creating an artificial blizzard in the coastal area around Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers could stabilize the West Antarctic Ice Sheet , reducing ice loss and significant sea level rise. Anders Levermann, physicist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and study coauthor, said in a statement The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the tipping elements in our climate system. Ice loss is accelerating and might not stop until the West Antarctic ice sheet is practically gone.Use drones to plant tree bombsImage credit AirSeed TechnologiesPlanting forests from the sky using drones has been explored as a solution against deforestation after wildfires and in areas that are difficult to reach. In Australia, AirSeed Technologies is using drones and AI to drop seed bombs in areas devastated by bushfires or flooding.. According to the U.N.s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, reforestation is vital to reduce the effects of climate change. A 2019 study found that there is space on Earth to plant hundreds of billions of trees, with the potential to reduce atmospheric carbon levels by 25. According to a 2020 study, replanting trees could reduce the U.S. carbon footprint by 14.Labgrown meatImage credit DKeine via Getty ImagesEating labgrown cultivated meat rather than livestockreared beef was previously thought to be better for the environment. Labgrown meat doesnt require pastures for grazing, uses less water and land for growing feed and produces less methane than cattle. However, a 2023 study found that the energy needed and greenhouse gases emitted at all stages of cultivated meat production is between four and 25 times higher than traditional beefrearing. This echoes the findings of a 2019 study that suggested that although cattle contribute to global warming by emitting methane, overall cultivated meat could be worse for the planet in the longterm. Although scientists havent yet found a lowemission solution to cultivating lab grown meat, from an animalwelfare perspective cultivated meat still has a positive impact.Eat a plantbased dietImage credit Yagi Studio via Getty ImagesIn a 2024 report, scientists found that in order to reduce greenhouse gases and global heating by 1.5 degrees Celsius, people need to consume fewer meat and animal products and switch to a mostly plantbased diet. This echoes an earlier 2020 report that found evidence that reducing meat consumption significantly and switching to a plantbased diet is the ultimate solution to reduce global emissions. A separate 2021 report found that animalbased foods emit twice the amount of global greenhouse gas emissions as plantbased foods.Plasticeating enzymesImage credit Gary Bell via Getty ImagesHumans are generating twice as much plastic as we did just two decades ago, with just 9of plastic successfully recycled. Plastic isnt biodegradable and can take up to 500 years to decompose, according to the United Nations. Figures from the University of Colorado show that the refinement of plastics emits 184 to 213 million metric tons of greenhouse gases each year. The disposal of singleuse plastics in landfills accounts for more than 15 of methane emissions. In 2022 Live Science reported that an AIengineered plasticeating bacteria had been developed that could solve the plastic problem. Researchers found a variant of an enzyme called hydrolase that can break down PET polyethylene terephthalate into component molecules. A separate 2023 study found evidence that structural biology could be used to develop an enzyme that eats plastic.Build cloudmaking shipsImage credit siamsmile via Getty ImagesScientists have explored installing a fleet of cloudmaking ships to increase cloud cover and cool the atmosphere. The technique, marine cloud brightening MCB, involves finding the aerosol particle size that is just right. Since there is a risk that particle size can either increase precipitation or increase evaporation, the optimal particle size and number will likely need to be matched to the target cloud, NOAA scientist Graham Feingold said in a statement. According to a 2021 study, stratocumulus decks, which cover large areas of Earths surface, would be the primary target.Build underwater walls to protect glaciersImage credit MB Photography via Getty ImagesWalls made of rock and sand on the seafloor could be used to protect undersea glaciers from melting and reduce the risk of sea levels rising in Antarctica, according to researchers. In a 2018 study, researchers explored this form of geoengineering to mitigate the impact of climate change on coastal areas. The structures would be used to stop warmer water from reaching the base of the glaciers, a leading cause of glacier melt. The Guardian reported that the base of the ice around the South Pole shrank by 556 square miles 1,463 square kilometers between 2010 and 2016.Dim the sunImage credit Vlad Georgescu via Getty ImagesAlthough dimming the sun wouldnt reverse climate change, it could create a cooling effect, researchers have found. According to a 2018 report, a solar engineering technique that reflects some of the suns rays into space could help limit the rise in global temperatures to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius and meet targets set in the Paris Agreement. According to a 2023 study, using a combination of solar engineering techniques to block some sunshine could also protect polar regions from melting.Spray arctic ice with glassImage credit kappaphoto via Getty ImagesSummer Arctic sea ice is shrinking at a rate of 12.2 per decade, compared to its average extent during the period from 1981 to 2010, satellite observations from NASA show. One solution could be to coat large swathes of the Arctic in a thin layer of reflective glass beads that protect young ice and allow older ice to form, according to the Arctic Ice Project, a nonprofit organization. Research experiments to test the geoengineering technique in lakes and rivers in Canada have demonstrated some successful results, according to a 2018 study.Paint buildings whiteImage credit Francesco Riccardo Iacomino via Getty ImagesPainting buildings in an ultracooling white paint could provide an affordable cooling solution, researchers have found. In many hot countries, such as Greece and Spain, white houses are the norm. They reflect the suns powerful rays, making the buildings cooler. In 2023, researchers invented a new ultrawhite formula that modeling experiments found reflects 98.1 of solar heat away from the surface. The paint gained an Innovation Award for its potential to keep surfaces cool and reduce the need for air conditioning.Recycle human wasteImage credit Karl Hendon via Getty ImagesResearchers have found that composting human waste to use as a fertilizer for agriculture reduces greenhouse gas emissions and wasteborne illnesses. A 2020 study published in Nature investigated the sanitation and composting of human waste at large slums in Haiti, where only 30 of the population has access to sewer sanitation. Researchers found that offsite composting had a methane emissions factor of 0.5, compared to 20 to 80from pit latrines and lagoons.Composting has a much smaller greenhouse gas footprint than all of the other nonsewer technologies that are used widely today, University of California, Merced Professor Rebecca Ryals and study coauthor said in a statement.Eat insectsImage credit Marco Bottigelli via Getty ImagesInsects could provide an alternative source of protein and reduce greenhouse emissions, according to the World Economic Forum. A 2017 study reported that cricket farms emit 75 less carbon dioxide and half as much water as poultry farms. Separate research from 2023 found evidence that edible insects, many of which are regarded as pests, could solve many environmental and health issues by reducing greenhouse gases emitted during food production and providing an additional food source as the global population continues to grow.Use algae for food, fuel and cementImage credit Artem Hvozdkov via Getty ImagesScientists researching the potential uses of microalgae for carbon capture and in medications and foods found that some species of algae form limestone, which can be used to make biocement and reduce carbon use. A 2024 study found evidence microalgae could be used as a biofuel and a greener solution to fossil fuels. A separate 2024 report found that algae is increasingly added as a nutritious ingredient in plantbased food. Compared to conventional plant and animal sources, the researchers found that algae used fewer natural resources to grow and harvest.Use the human body as an energy sourceImage credit Martin Llado via Getty ImagesRather than cooling the heat produced by humans in busy urban areas, scientists are using human heat to warm buildings. In Sweden, an ecooffice building situated above Stockholm Central Station recovers the excess body heat produced by thousands of commuters.. Using heat exchangers, the excess heat is converted to warm water, which supplies up to 20 of the office heating. To cool the building, water is extracted from a nearby lake.Use asbestos to remove CO2 from the airImage credit Carlos Ciudad Photos via Getty ImagesScientists are exploring how asbestos in its natural form could be used as a carbon sink to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Asbestos is a naturallyoccurring fibrous silicate mineral that is harmless in the soil, but when manufactured, it becomes a carcinogenic compound that causes serious health problems when breathed in. In a 2019 study, scientists reported how the waste from mining, including asbestos, could be used to capture carbon.Paint mountains whiteImage credit Paul Biris via Getty ImagesIn 2010, a Peruvian inventor whitewashed a mountain summit in the Peruvian Andes in an experiment to see if it could protect against glacier melt by reflecting heat away from the peaks. The Glaciares de Peru Projects early example of geoengineering won a 200,000 prize as part of the World Banks 100 Ideas to Save the Planet competition. In 2023, Reuters reported that 56 of Perus tropical glaciers had disappeared in the last six decades as a result of climate change.Grow more sea ice in the ArcticImage credit Jami Tarris via Getty ImagesIn 2023, researchers from the Centre for Climate Repair at the University of Cambridge undertook an experiment in Cambridge Bay in the Arctic Circle to drill and pump seawater across the surface to freeze and therefore thicken the ice. This, the team said, could protect it from melting and restore lost ice to mitigate some of the effects of carbon emissions. The 2024 study examining the impact of the experiment found evidence of freezing further away from the point of injection, suggesting thickening ice in the Arctic could be a helpful strategy to mitigate further ice loss.Live in trash housesImage credit Reza Estakhrian via Getty ImagesThe construction industry is responsible for a large proportion of global carbon emissions and it sends a huge amount of waste to landfills each year. The European Commission estimates the industry produces over a third of the European Unions waste. Approximately half of the 100 billion tons of raw materials extracted across the globe annually are used in construction. One solution being tested is using recycling materials such as plastic to create bricks. A 2022 study reported that the use of recycled building materials, such as plastic, glass, concrete and steel, during construction could reduce the environmental impact caused by construction by up to 65.Bury carbon undergroundImage credit Public Domain via U.S. Geological SurveyCapturing and storing carbon, a process known as carbon sequestration, can reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and lessen its impact on the environment. In a 2022 study, researchers investigated the importance of erosion in carbon burial to see if subsoil could be used with frontier technologies to store greater quantities of carbon. Scientists found evidence to indicate that subsoil could be used to capture carbon with large quantities of carbon recorded in centuries old subsoil.Spacebased solar powerImage credit European Space Agency  ESAEuropean SPS Tower conceptSince the 1920s, scientists have been exploring how spacebased solar power can be harvested and transmitted back to Earth.According to NASA, large orbital solar panels could be blasted into space, and the energy they collect then sent back to our planet using laser or microwave beams. A 2024 report by NASA evaluated the potential cost and conditions needed to deliver spacebased solar power and the role NASA could play in developing technologies to harness this energy.According to the European Space Agency, sunlight is 10 times more intense in the atmosphere than it is on Earths surface, and spacebased solar power could aid in Europe achieving a netzero greenhouse gas emission target by 2050.Fly lessImage credit Daniel Garrido via Getty ImagesTraveling by plane contributes significantly to climate change. The aviation industry generates up to 2.4 of global carbon emissions annually, according to a report published in the Atmospheric Environment Journal. The Environment and Energy Study Institute reported that the hypermobility of air travel caused the annual global passenger count to reach 4.56 billion people in 2019. In a 2022 study, researchers investigated how behavioral changes, such as abstaining from flying, choosing an alternative means of transport and carbon offsetting, could be encouraged to reduce individual impact.Grow algae in the ocean to reduce acidityImage credit Justin Lewis via Getty ImagesThe ocean absorbs around a third of the planets carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, as carbon dioxide emissions have increased, scientists have found that seawater has become more acidic, and less effective at carbon capture. But algae can help calcify the water by releasing enzymes that break down carbon dioxide into bicarbonate ions. These ions can then be used for calcification. In a 2016 study, scientists found that algae helps the water stay neutral and absorb more carbon.Reintroduce woolly mammothsImage credit Science Photo Library  LEONELLO CALVETTI via Getty ImagesIn a project reminiscent of Jurassic Park, scientists from Harvard University have explored bringing woolly mammoths back to life.According to researchers from the Woolly Mammoth Revival Project, reintroducing previously extinct large animals and herbivores to Arctic environments could reduce greenhouse gases by acting as a natural geoengineer. By trampling around, they could help grasslands  which absorb less heat than trees  to thrive, while preventing permafrost to thaw.Train cattle to use the looImage credit Ekaterina Korzh via Getty ImagesResearchers from New Zealand have successfully potty trained cattle to use a toilet, nicknamed a MooLoo.The projects aims to reduce ammonia emissions from urine and dung from leaching into the soil and nearby water sources, causing nitrous oxide  a type of greenhouses gas  and acid rain. According to the 2021 report, a single cow can produce 30 liters of urine daily. Ammonia is produced when this urine combines with feces. Although urine isnt as damaging as the methane produced by farting and burping cattle, the nitrous oxide from urine was found to make up 5 of all greenhouse gases from agriculture in the U.K. in 2019.Build wind farms in the skyImage credit Courtesy of the SkySails GroupAirborne technology could be a solution in the fight against climate change. These technologies, such as huge kites, are being explored as a method for harvesting wind power high above the ground and in remote locations where conventional wind turbines cant be installed.According to a 2013 study, highaltitude winds are generally more powerful than nearsurface winds, resulting in up to 4.5 times higher average power densities.Use nature to encourage people to care about the planetImage credit pipat wongsawang via Getty ImagesThe United Nations has outlined 10 actions that people can take to reduce their carbon footprint and save the planet. These include using less energy, consuming fewer products generally such as clothing, electronics, recycling more and using greener modes of travel.According to a 2023 study conducted by researchers at the University of Tokyo, people who spend more time in nature are more likely to care about the natural environment and take action to protect it. Researchers found evidence that giving people a chance to experience nature boosts empathy for the health of the planet and encourages prosocial behavior.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Heres how it works. Climate change made wildfires that decimated the Pantanal wetland in Brazil this year 40 more intense, according to research. Image credit Lucas NinnoGetty Images Global temperatures will soar to 3.1 degrees Celsius 5.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels by 2100 if governments dont set more ambitious climate targets, a new United Nations U.N. report warns.Warming on this scale is more than twice the 1.5 C 2.7 F target outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement  a legally binding treaty on climate change adopted by 196 countries  and would plunge the world headlong into climate disaster.Current levels of humaninduced warming are about 1.3 C 2.3 F above preindustrial levels, meaning we could reach 1.5 C in less than a decade, according to the U.N.s annual Emissions Gap Report, which highlights the gap between countries commitments and the cuts in greenhouse gas emissions needed to prevent climate breakdown.We are teetering on a planetary tightrope, U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said in a speech following the publication of the report on Oct. 24. This report shows annual greenhouse gas emissions at an alltime high, rising 1.3 last year. They must fall 9 each year to 2030 to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 C and avoid the very worst of climate change.Related Michael Mann Yes, we can still stop the worst effects of climate change. Heres why.Global greenhouse gas emissions reached 63 gigatons of carbon dioxide CO2 equivalent in 2023, which is 0.8 gigaton  or 1.3  higher than 2022 levels, according to the report. A gigaton is equivalent to 10,000 fullyloaded U.S. aircraft carriers, according to NASA, and CO2 equivalent is a metric that takes into account the potential warming effects of different greenhouse gases. This rate of increase exceeds rates observed before the COVID19 pandemic between 2010 and 2019, when growth averaged 0.8 year over year. The new spike in emissions reflects a return to prepandemic levels of activity in the industrial and transport sectors.Hopes of keeping the 1.5 C target alive depend on countries collectively cutting yearly greenhouse gas emissions by 42 before 2030 and then by 57 before 2035, the report said. But current pledges for future action are not drastic enough to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the worlds most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms  Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.There is a direct link between increasing emissions and increasingly frequent and intense climate disasters, Guterres said. Around the world, people are paying a terrible price.The reports findings come two weeks before the annual U.N. Conference of the Parties COP climate summit on Nov. 11 to Nov. 22 in Baku, Azerbaijan. Leaders from around the world will gather to build on an agreement made last year to transition away from fossil fuels, and many hope these negotiations will lead to more ambitious, countryspecific climate targets. Emissions Gap Report 2024  A message from the UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres  YouTube Watch On If we look at the progress toward 2030 targets, especially of the G20 member states  they have not made a lot of progress toward their current climate targets for 2030, Anne Olhoff, chief climate adviser at the U.N.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Heres how it works. Japanese musicians performed the composition for the first time in 2023. Image credit Hiroto Nagai, iScience 2024 A Japanese scientist has taken inspiration from the climate crisis to compose music that sounds as ominous as current forecasts of ecological breakdown.Hiroto Nagai, a geoenvironmental scientist and associate professor at Rissho University in Tokyo, compiled publicly available climate data from the Arctic and Antarctic to produce a 6minute chamber music composition for string quartet. Musicians performed the piece in February 2023, with footage of the recital released on YouTube two months later. Nagai then gathered feedback and described the work that went into the music in a study, which was published online April 18, 2024 in the journal iScience.The aim of the experiment was to raise awareness of climate change through art. One of the main insights from the participants is that music, unlike usual graphical representations of scientific data, evokes an emotional impression first, Nagai wrote in the study. It grabs the audiences attention forcefully, while graphical representations require active and conscious recognition instead.The climate data used for the composition spans the last 30 years. Nagai extracted records of solar radiation, surface temperature, precipitation and cloud thickness from four weather stations in the Arctic and Antarctica to represent the energy budget of Earths poles.Related Creepy biotwang noises coming from the Mariana Trench finally explained after 10 yearsThe energy budget of a region is the balance between the amount of energy incoming from the sun and the amount of energy that is reflected back into space. Earths energy budget depends on the albedo effect, which dictates that darkcolored surfaces, such as oceans and forests, reflect less energy back into space than lightcolored surfaces. Given that polar regions are covered in snow and ice, they reflect almost all the solar radiation that reaches them.But climate change is reducing the amount of ice at the poles, throwing Earths energy budget off kilter. Rising temperatures are causing entire ice shelves to collapse and the extent of sea ice to shrink yearonyear. As ice melts, it exposes darker surfaces that absorb more solar radiation, leading to increased warming and triggering a climate feedback loop.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the worlds most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms  Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over. String Quartet No.1 Polar Energy Budget by Hiroto NAGAI Performance Video for Study  YouTube Watch On Nagai used software to convert the data into sheet music. He separated the various datasets into sections labeled A to I, with the shape of the music on the page roughly mirroring the curves of the data. He then made stylistic additions and changes to the music to avoid repetitive sequences.The process of transforming data into sound is known as sonification. While researchers previously tried this method, the resulting soundscapes didnt sound like conventional music due to a lack of stylistic changes.RELATED STORIESListen to haunting sounds of Earths magnetic field flipping 41,000 years ago in eerie new animationThe speed of sound on Mars is constantly changing, bizarre study findsListen to the sounds of Pando, the largest living tree in the worldThere is a tendency to avoid intentional interventions or edits i.e., contamination in the original data, Nagai wrote in the study. As a result, while the information from the original data are preserved as much as possible, composed musical pieces often contain a monotonous progression and lack any significant dynamics.Nagais composition, titled Polar Energy Budget, includes both dataderived melodies and free arrangements. The choice of a string quartet two violins, a viola and a cello was based on the fourvoice structure and diversity of playing techniques of these instruments.This marks a significant turning point from an era where only scientists handled data to an era where artists can freely use data to create their works, Nagai concluded in the study.

Image credit DeAgostini via Getty Images Fools gold may be driving a disturbing climate feedback loop in the Canadian Arctic.Erosion of rocks like pyrite, or fools gold, releases carbon dioxide. And thanks to that weathering, CO2 emissions from Canadas Mackenzie River Basin could double by 2100, a change equivalent to half the current annual emissions from the countrys aviation industry, a new study found.Sulfide minerals like pyrite react with oxygen and other minerals to release sulfate and carbon dioxide. As warming causes more Arctic permafrost to thaw, more rocks are exposed to the atmosphere and weathered, creating a positive feedback loop in emissions. The researchers published their findings Oct. 9 in the journal Science Advances.The relationship with temperature appears to be exponential, coauthor Robert Hilton, a professor of geology at the University of Oxford, told Live Science. That means it appears to be accelerating as the region warms.Scientists still dont know if there are natural brakes on this climate feedback loop, but better understanding how rates of weathering, and carbon dioxide emissions, will change in response to rising temperatures and environmental changes is crucial to predicting future warming.Related Greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than CO2 is rising in the atmosphere  and fastTo look for clues, the researchers took records of sulfate concentrations sulfate, like CO2, is a product of sulfide weathering and corresponding temperatures from 23 locations across the Mackenzie River Basin, the largest river system in Canada.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the worlds most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms  Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.They found that sulfate increased rapidly with temperature. Between 1960 and 2020, sulfide weathering increased by 45 as temperatures rose by 2.3 degrees Celsius 4.14 degrees Fahrenheit.These chemical reactions appear to be occurring at their fastest rates in mountain regions where rocks are broken open by water seeping in and expanding as it freezes, a process known as frost cracking. They are slower in lowland regions where peat forms a protective layer between the rocks and the air, the researchers note.But the exact extent of the problem is unclear, Hilton said. Sulfide rocks are believed to exist across the Arctic, including the Canadian Rockies, Svalbard and Greenland, but their concentrations remain understudied. Additionally, there could be other environmental factors, such as less permafrost melting or more soil forming, that could slow down this weathering.This could be if the landscape stabilizes, and we run out of minerals to react. This could be over 10s to 100s of years, we dont know, Hilton said. We think the rates are highest where exposed rocks are weathering. This means settings where soil develops could see a slow down, for instance as the Arctic greens. But again, we lack data on the timescales of this response, and we dont see any slow down in our data.RELATED STORIESNew map of methane superemitters shows some of the largest methane clouds ever seenLarge patch of the Atlantic Ocean near the equator has been cooling at record speeds  and scientists cant figure out whyWe could be 16 years into a methanefueled termination event significant enough to end an ice ageThe researchers are also investigating ways to mitigate this process.These reactions arent just happening in the Arctic. They seem to be increasing in other places where rocks have been exposed by deforestation and land use change, for example in the European Alps, Hilton said. In those locations it may be more feasible to consider solutions which have cobenefits  for example reforestation which could act to lower these rock mineral reactions and CO2 release, while building tree biomass and soil carbon stocks.And while the weathering feedback loop is an important source of emissions in the region, its probably a smaller problem than the release of methane and carbon dioxide from thawing permafrost, Hilton said.I would say its important not to be too alarmist about this, Hilton said.

More than half of the worlds food production is at risk of collapsing in the next 25 years due to a growing global water crisis, a new report warns.Climate change, destructive land use and the consistent mismanagement of water resources mean that nearly 3 billion people and over half of global food production are in areas facing unprecedented stress on their water systems, the Global Commission on the Economics of Water said in a report released Oct. 17.If the trend is not reversed, the growing deficit will have a seismic impact on humanity and the environment. Several cities are already sinking due to a loss of groundwater. Moreover, up to 8 of the global gross domestic product GDP, and 15 of the GDP of lowerincome countries, will be lost by 2050, according to the report.Today, half of the worlds population faces water scarcity, Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research PIK and one of the commissions four cochairs, said in a statement. As this vital resource becomes increasingly scarce, food security and human development are at risk  and we are allowing this to happen.For the first time in human history, we are pushing the global water cycle out of balance, he continued. Precipitation, the source of all freshwater, can no longer be relied upon due to human caused climate and land use change, undermining the basis for human wellbeing and the global economy.Related Will the US run out of water?Each person needs a bare minimum of 13 to 26 gallons 50 to 100 liters of water a day for their health and hygiene, but the commission found that this number, which governments often rely on, is a vast underestimate.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the worlds most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms  Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The real number for adequate consumption and a dignified life is closer to 1,055 gallons 4,000 liters per person each day, the report authors wrote. This volume is unobtainable in many parts of the world, placing additional pressure on trade to provide adequate food, clothing and consumer goods.Current approaches to the water crisis focus predominantly on the blue water found in rivers, lakes and aquifers, while overlooking the vital green water contained in soil and plants. This water cycles around the world in atmospheric rivers to generate roughly half of the rainfall that falls on land.Areas in India, China, Russia and Europe are highly dependent on green water flow, placing them under ever greater threat of water scarcity as weather systems are disrupted. In recent years, the Amazon has undergone severe droughts that threaten to transform the rainforest into savanna, glaciers have melted at unprecedented speeds, and Europe has suffered deadly flooding. A previous study has also highlighted the dangers in North America, with nearly half of the United States 204 freshwater basins projected to fall beneath demand by 2071.RELATED STORIES Submerged human corpses rise from droughtstricken Lake MeadYellowstones geysers at risk of extinction from climate change, tree skeletons revealCatastrophic climate doom loops could start in just 15 years, new study warnsCompounding the issue is the widespread underpricing of water in many areas. This enables water use in alreadystressed regions to be diverted to rapidly growing data centers and coalfired power plants. By introducing proper pricing and subsidies, shifting to plantbased diets, restoring natural habitats and recycling wastewater, the researchers argue that water can be distributed more efficiently and equitably.The global water crisis is a tragedy but is also an opportunity to transform the economics of water  and to start by valuing water properly so as to recognize its scarcity and the many benefits it delivers, Ngozi OkonjoIweala, director general of the World Trade Organization and a cochair of the commission, said in the statement.The Global Commission on the Economics of Water was established by the Netherlands in 2022, using the expertise of dozens of scientists and economists to create a 202page report assessing all aspects of the current crisis and suggesting solutions for politicians.

As global temperatures continue to rise, risking the lives and livelihoods of people living in poverty and precarity, we must act now to curb the emissions of the superrich and make rich polluters pay, Oxfam declared. The report is titled Carbon Inequality Kills Why Curbing the Excessive Emissions of an Elite Few Can Create a Sustainable Planet for All. Its central contention is that the One Percenters create far too many carbon emissions through both their lifestyles yachts, private jets, mansions and business investments. The report is short on science, but very long on hyperbole, offering all sorts of mediafriendly pullquote anecdotes meant to show how awful the One Percenters are by comparing their carbon emissions to everyone else. If everyone began emitting as much carbon as those in the top 1, the remaining carbon budget would be gone in fewer than five months, said one example. If everyone emitted carbon at the same rate as the luxury transport emissions of 50 of the worlds richest billionaires, the remaining carbon budget would be gone in two days, said another. The bulk of the report consisted of estimates, projections, and measurements intended to demonstrate the luxuries of the pollutocrats are unreasonable, and so are their investments in every industry Oxfams authors found unacceptable. The report stumbled right out of the gate by admitting that only 23 of 50 of the worlds richest billionaires even have private jets, but the authors proceeded to dutifully tally up how many metric tons of carbon they emit. The report paid extraspecial attention to the Lefts new most hated billionaire, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose two private jets produce the equivalent of 834 years worth of emissions for the average person in the world. If Musk thought creating the only truly successful line of electric vehicles in the Western world was going to win him some affection from the Greens, he was sadly mistaken. Another rich family despised by the Left, the Waltons of Walmart fame, came in for a beating over their three superyachts, which generate the equivalent of the carbon emissions of around 1,700 Walmart shop workers. The report would have petered out with a sad trombone if it only fussed over the private planes and yachts owned by billionaires, since they collectively emit only a tiny fraction of humanitys emissions, no matter how many alarming factoids are cooked up to make them seem outrageous. To build the One Percent into a planetraping menace that must be stopped at all costs, Oxfam threw in the investment footprint of the superrich  in other words, holding them personally accountable for every puff of CO2 emitted by every industry they invest in. This total was then used to calculate the economic cost of the worlds superrich as 52.6 trillion  a hilariously misleading factoid that simply ignores all of the wealth generated by Western industry and totals up the estimated cost of their emissions. Even the dollar figures tossed about in the report are a politicized flimflam, as Oxfams authors grudgingly admitted they didnt use actual dollars  they invented a new imaginary currency called international dollars that adjusts for Purchasing Power Parity between rich and poor nations. As for all the deaths supposedly inflicted by the superrich grim reapers with their carbon sickles, Oxfam held the One Percenters responsible for people dying from heat stroke around the world, by attributing every such death to global warming and holding the wealthy responsible for 90 percent of global warming The number of people exposed to extreme heat is growing exponentially, and various studies predict a drastic increase of excess deaths due to heat. Based on a recent study, Oxfam has estimated the numbers of deaths attributable to the emissions of the superrich. Our findings show that even in an optimistic climate change scenario, just four years of the emissions of the worlds richest people are driving up global temperatures enough to contribute to a shocking number of excess deaths. The Oxfam report mentions the worlds worst polluter, China, only twice  and not to hold the Communist country responsible for its titanic emissions, which dwarf those of every superrich Western tycoon who has ever lived combined, but to portray the Chinese as a victim of capitalist climate change, because China will supposedly have trouble importing enough soybeans to feed its population. The report included no mention of the carbon emissions the Left doesnt want to talk about the fact that huge numbers of people are eagerly migrating from very lowcarbon societies to rich Western countries, which will magnify their carbon footprints enormously. No one in the climate movement seems interested in how much carbon emissions will be increased by moving millions of subsistence farmers into the wealthy and industrialized economies of North America and Europe. Oxfam was also serenely unconcerned with the gigantic carbon emissions of powerful politicians, including those who make a point of using fleets of carbonspewing private jets to attend climate conferences. Instead, the report urged making socialist politicians even richer and more powerful by helping them confiscate wealth from the capitalists who create it. The mission statement of Carbon Inequality Kills is that its time to make rich polluters pay by slamming them with confiscatory taxes. A tax of 60 on the incomes of the richest 1 of earners globally would cut emissions equivalent to more than the UKs total emissions in 2019, the authors advised, but that was merely the salad bar portion of the sevencourse meal of taxes they had in mind. Oxfam also demanded an additional, higher rate of tax on anything they decided was a polluting investment, beginning with the sale of fossil fuels or products running on them. In other words, they want to outlaw cars, or slap them with taxes that would make it impossible for the working poor and middle class to afford them. The authors also wanted even more taxes on carbonintensive luxury consumptions, starting with private jets, superyachts, sport utility vehicles SUVs, and frequent air travel. They suggested a punitive rate of 90 percent on anything they decided was a luxury, although it would be better for governments to ban them outright. Soccer moms and business travelers would doubtless be surprised to find themselves lined up against the wall next to Elon Musk and the Walton family as traitors to the glorious climate revolution, their SUVs suddenly reclassified as a menace on par with Learjets. The report also suggested extra taxes on windfall profits, additional fees for climate finance, penalties for corporations that fail to keep climate promises, and 5 trillion in climate reparations paid to the Global South by the Global North. Both globally and at the national level, the incomes of the top 10 should be no higher than the bottom 40, they pronounced, demanding whatever confiscation and redistribution was necessary to achieve that goal. The Oxfam authors resolutely refused to consider the possibility that these gigantic tax increases would reduce economic activity, bringing in far less revenue than projected. Instead, they anticipated raking in about 10 trillion a year with their 90 percent luxury taxes and 60 percent income taxes. The authors also anticipated resistance from the people they intended to loot for their redistribution schemes, so they wrapped up by commanding the free world to reject neoliberal economics  in other words, freemarket capitalism and representative democracy  to put the State at the center of delivering healthy and prosperous societies that are good for the people and the planet. This means rejecting the assumption that the only way to transform our society away from fossil fuel dependence is by enabling andor subsidizing private actors, they explained. The climate change movement is increasingly clear that its vision of a lowcarbon world is not a vision of a free or prosperous humanity, and socialists are increasingly clear that they see the climate movement as a vehicle for extracting more money and power from unwilling populations.

BRICS is an antiAmerican coalition initially consisting of the countries that make up its name Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. In January, the group added four more members Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates UAE. Argentina and Saudi Arabia were also invited to join, but Argentina declined the invitation, while Saudi Arabia has refused to formally confirm or reject the invitation. Reports prior to the beginning of the annual summit this week suggested that clarifying Saudi Arabias position in the bloc would be a priority, but at press time BRICS has offered no update on the Saudi situation. In addition to member states, Russia, the summits host country this year, invited dozens of world leaders from BRICSfriendly governments. Russian officials claimed 33 countries sent highlevel representatives, many including heads of state, to the summit, hosted by the Russian regional capital of Kazan. Reports throughout the week indicated that BRICS member countries are debating creating a secondtier of BRICS cooperation for partner countries that are not full members. One report suggested on Wednesday that BRICS would invite 13 countries  including Nigeria, Turkey, Cuba, and Belarus  to obtain partner status. BRICS boasts some of the most malign geopolitical influences on the globe. China and India perennially appear on lists of the worlds worst polluters. China is conducting arguably the largest ongoing genocide on the planet against the indigenous Uyghur, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz people of occupied East Turkistan. Ethiopia also stands accused of genocidal tactics to repress the ethnic Tigray population in that country. Iran is the worlds most prolific state sponsor of terrorism, responsible for funding a host of terrorist organizations in the Middle East and beyond including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Yemeni Houthi movement, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the terrorists of the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces. Brazil, under socialist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, is leading an international censorship campaign against conservative and other rightwing voices under the guise of fighting misinformation. Russia, China, Iran, Egypt, and India all face credible accusations of religious persecution, either staterun or, in the case of India, led by violent Hindu radicals who the government does little to contain. The objective of the BRICS coalition is to erode American and Western influence generally on the global stage. This years BRICS declaration targets nearly every aspect of the Westernled world order, including restructuring the United Nations, financial institutions, human rights standards, law enforcement and counterterrorism, and environmental standards. The extensive declaration from the Kazan summit described the three pillars of the BRICS coalition as political and security cooperation, economic and financial work, and cultural and peopletopeople cooperation. The most strident condemnations in the document were made against the concept of human rights and other economic sanctions, which have damaged host nation Russias ability to maintain its economy. Russia faces extensive Western sanctions in response to its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. We are deeply concerned about the disruptive effect of unlawful unilateral coercive measures, including illegal sanctions, on the world economy, international trade, and the achievement of the sustainable development goals, the declaration stated. The state parties also condemned the attempts to subject development to discriminatory politically motivated practices, meaning human rights sanctions and other measures to prevent repressive states from enriching themselves through global finance systems. The document claimed that its signatories supported promoting and protecting human rights, but only under the principles of equality and mutual respect, and identified the right to development as a primary right. Global institutions such as the United Nations, the states declared, should address human rights in a nonpoliticised and constructive manner and without double standards. The same documented declared disinformation, misinformation, including propagating false narratives and fake news, as well as hate speech especially on digital platforms as a primary concern. While reaffirming commitment to sovereignty of States we emphasize the importance of information integrity and ensuring free flow of and public access to accurate factbased information, the declaration claimed, including the freedom of opinion and expression as well as digital and media literacy in order to allow for meaningful connectivity, in accordance with applicable national and international law. The declaration mentioned womens rights in some form six times, despite the inclusion of Iran in the BRICS bloc, one of the worlds most repressive states for women. Egypt and India are also notoriously dangerous sites for women, with minimal law enforcement safeguards against rape, violence, and other forms of abuse. Just as the declaration claims support for human rights while condemning enforcement mechanisms to secure human rights, the BRICS countries claimed to take the alleged climate crisis seriously while condemning mechanisms to encourage state parties to mitigate carbon emissions and other pollution. We reject unilateral, punitive and discriminatory protectionist measures, that are not in line with international law, under the pretext of environmental concerns, the document read, such as unilateral and discriminatory carbon border adjustment mechanisms CBAMs, due diligence requirements, taxes and other measures. We condemn unilateral measures introduced under the pretext of climate and environmental concerns and reiterate our commitment to enhancing coordination on these issues, the document continued. We are deeply concerned with attempts to link security with the climate change agenda. The document also explicitly promotes the concept of special and differential treatment SDT for developing countries, meaning countries identified as developing  which currently including the worlds secondlargest economy, China  receive financial windfalls and are not beholden to the same environmental, human rights, financial propriety, and other standards as developed nations. Again, on the issue of terrorism, the BRICS members claimed unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms  while stating they reject any attempts at politicization of counterterrorism issues and the use of terrorist groups to achieve political ends. BRICS did not, as expected, condemn Iran for its outsized role in funding and supporting international terrorism. The BRICS statement did address the fact that one of Irans proxies, the Yemeni Houthis, are waging a terrorist campaign against global commerce, but did not mention the Houthis or condemn the parties involved. We stress the importance of ensuring the exercise of navigational rights and freedoms of vessels of all states in the Red Sea and Bab AlMandab Strait, in accordance with international law the document read. We encourage enhanced diplomatic efforts by all parties to that end, including by addressing the causes of the conflict, and continued support for dialogue and Yemens peace process under UN auspices. The declaration did condemn Israel for its selfdefense measures against the Iranbacked terrorist organization Hamas, demanding an immediate ceasefire in Hamascontrolled Gaza, which would enable the terrorists to reconstruct their operation.

Climate Alarmism Summit Host Azerbaijan Plans Major Fossil Fuel Expansion 25 AP PhotoMikhail MetzelJohn Hayward23 Oct 2024 Climate groups are crying foul that Azerbaijan, host of the COP29 global climate summit in November, is planning to dramatically increase its production of natural gas over the next decade. The UK Guardian on Wednesday cited a joint report from two environmental groups called Urgewald and CEE Bankwatch, that denounced Azerbaijans climate plans as critically insufficient. Azerbaijan is among a tiny group of countries that has weakened its climate target and the country is doubling down on fossil fuel extraction, the report said. The report said Azerbaijans state oil and gas company, Socar, is planning to increase natural gas production from 37 billion cubic meters bcm in 2024 to 49 bcm by 2033. Some of this production will drive a 17percent increase in exports to the European Union EU, which was highly dependent upon Russian natural gas before the Ukraine invasion. Given Socars pivotal role in Azerbaijans economy and its close ties to the countrys political elite, its influence will surely be felt throughout the climate negotiations in Baku, report author Regine Ricter told the Guardian. Baku is the capital of Azerbaijan, where the climate conference will be held in November. As we prepare for COP29, we cannot but ask ourselves did we put the fox in charge of the henhouse? Richter asked. The management of the COP29 conference disagreed with this dour assessment, insisting that Azerbaijans increased gas production was reasonable and in line with U.N. plans to ensure the global transition away from fossil fuels is just and orderly. Azerbaijan is investing in gas capacity in response to a European request to increase supplies following the disruption of supplies from Russia, a conference representative said. Azerbaijan is intensively developing its abundant solar and wind resources as part of its commitment to becoming a leading supplier of green energy, the representative added. The Guardian suggested one reason climate groups are irritated by Azerbaijans natural gas heresy is that last years COP28 conference was held in oilrich Dubai and presided over by Sultan Al Jaber, president of the United Arab Emirates UAE state oil company Adnoc. The sultan was an outspoken critic of alarmist demands for an immediate end to fossil fuels and some climate groups accused him of engineering a disappointing outcome to COP28. Those activists are now seething as even the vague promise to transition away gradually from fossil fuels at COP28 is betrayed by increased gas production from the host of COP29. Another aggravating echo of the last climate conference is that Socar, like Adnoc, has a heavyhitting political patron in the form of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, an Islamist who regards his countrys natural resources as a gift from God to be exploited with gusto. Azerbaijans heavenly gifts include about 2.5 trillion cubic meters of natural gas, plus about 7 billion barrels of oil, including hearty offshore drilling in the Caspian Sea. Whatever Azerbaijan might be planning to do about solar and wind power in the future, it is currently about 98 percent dependent on fossil fuels, with 90 percent of its electricity coming from natural gas. Some climate activists deride Azerbaijans modest investments in green energy as a smokescreen for increased fossil fuel production  at best an effort to slightly reduce domestic reliance on natural gas so Socar has more product to export, at worst a bit of theatrical greenwashing to make European customers feel better about buying Azerbaijani gas and oil.

Williams, Ph.D.22 Oct 2024 A fringe group of climate scientists have published an apocalyptic report warning that much of the very fabric of life on Earth is imperiled by climate change, in the latest attack on lowcost fossil fuels. Led by Oregonbased climate activists William J. Ripple and Christopher Wolf, the writers assert that humanity is on the brink of an irreversible climate disaster because of increasing greenhouse gas emissions and ecosystem change. This is a global emergency beyond any doubt, they declare in their BioScience article titled The 2024 state of the climate report Perilous times on planet Earth. We are stepping into a critical and unpredictable new phase of the climate crisis. The authors point to 35 planetary vital signs, insisting that 25 are at record levels, driving a series of unprecedented climatelinked disasters over the past year. Reading between the lines, however, it becomes evident that what really rankles the writers is humanitys ongoing insistence on using readily available, lowcost fossil fuels instead of transitioning to undependable, expensive renewables. Fossil fuel emissions have increased to an alltime high, the authors lament, and climate impacts escalate, bringing forth scenes of unprecedented disasters around the world and human and nonhuman suffering. We are concerned about recent trends in many planetary vital signs, including recordbreaking greenhouse gas concentrations, tree cover loss due to wildfires and ice loss, Ripple states. We are especially troubled by global consumption of coal and oil reaching alltime highs in 2023. The climate crisis is becoming increasingly severe, and we are now faced with many climaterelated disasters along with catastrophic risks in the longer term, he adds. We are continuing to go in the wrong direction, with enormous fossil fuel emissions and unsustainable consumption by the wealthy. As is customary in doomsday articles such as this one, the authors threaten a humanitycrushing climate disaster without ever showing how it will come about. Will billions drown from flooding? Will entire cities sink into the earth? Will children bake in their homes from kilnlike temperatures? We are left to guess. We find ourselves amid an abrupt climate upheaval, a dire situation never before encountered in the annals of human existence, the authors confidently declare. We have now brought the planet into climatic conditions never witnessed by us or our prehistoric relatives within our genus, Homo, they add. What the authors do share with us is their conviction that we are headed toward a complex situation where climate controlling feedback loops and tipping point systems are interconnected in a way that could trigger selfperpetuating processes that amplify warming beyond human control. This severe climate scenario could ultimately help trigger societal collapse a possibility that is the focus of increasing research, the report ominously warns. What is to be done to avert Armageddon? Nothing short of immediate, high impact, and socially just climate policies are needed to avoid a further decline of Earths vital signs, Ripple contends, prioritizing a rapid phase down of fossil fuel use. In addition, the adoption of a sufficiently high global carbon price could help to dramatically reduce emissions while providing further funding for climate action, he suggests. Predictably, the report also proposes stabilising and gradually reducing the human population, despite the rising concerns of a serious population implosion that is already negatively affecting many parts of the globe. Ripple insists that the upcoming UN COP29 climate summit  scheduled to begin this November in Baku, Azerbaijan  should produce a binding agreement on global fossil fuel phaseout, along with a rapid timeline to kickstart climate action. We also hope that wealthy countries will increase their climate finance pledges to better support the Global South in scaling up renewable energy capacity and adapting to climate change, he argues.

GOP Democrat and independent voters react in realtime to Ohio Senator JD Vances claims that he and former President Trump care about the environment during Tuesday nights CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. Credit CBS Republican Democrat and independent voters reacted differently when Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio stated that he and former President Trump support clean air clean water while responding to a question on the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate stage about climate change the Fox News Debate Dial showed. Look a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think its important for us first of all to say Donald Trump and I support clean air clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer Vance said. The Fox News Debate Dial showed support among independents and Democrats dipping downward when Vance made that statement. Support among Republicans remained fairly consistent. But support among independent viewers began to rise again when Vance referenced how Democrats bring up carbon emissions when discussing climate change. This idea that carbon emissions drives all of the climate change. Well lets just say thats true just for the sake of argument. So were not arguing about weird science. Lets just say thats true Vance said. Well if you believe that what would you would you want to do The answer is that youd want to reshore as much American manufacturing as possible and youd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America because were the cleanest economy in the entire world. TIM WALZ THE SOLUTION IS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IDEA THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL Sen. JD Vance ROhio speaks during the vicepresidential debate at CBS Studios on Oct. 1 2024 in New York City. Ricky CariotiThe Washington Post via Getty Images The dial for independents remained flat as Vance moved into criticizing Kamala Harris on energy policy. Support among Democrats took a dive by contrast. What have Kamala Harris policies actually lead to more energy production in China more manufacturing overseas more doing business in some of the dirtiest parts of the entire world Vance said. When I say that I mean the amount of carbon emissions theyre doing per unit of economic output. So if we actually care about getting cleaner air and cleaner water the best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers and the American people. And unfortunately Kamala Harris has done exactly the opposite.

Senator Vance according to CBS news polling 7 in 10 Americans and more than 60 of Republicans under the age of 45 favor the U.S. taking steps to try and reduce climate change. Senator what responsibility would the Trump administration have to try and reduce the impact of climate change Vance began his response by recognizing the hurricane as an unbelievable unspeakable human tragedy and recalling a photograph of grandparents and a sixyearold child on a roof that later collapsed causing those people to lose their lives. Im sure Governor Waltz joins me and saying our hearts go out to those innocent people our prayers go out to them Vance said. And we want as robust and aggressive as a federal response as we can get to save as many lives as possible. And then of course afterwards to help the people in those communities rebuild. Sen.

Just when you thought it was safe to cook up your fall chili recipe in peace the city of Berkeley California is rolling out a new natural gas ban initiative set to rekindle the politically flammable issue that everyone else would prefer to move on from before it all boils over once again. Undaunted by its unequivocal loss in the courts last year Berkeleys city leaders have released a new strategy to curb natural gas use this time by imposing taxes on large buildings in which it is used. As if theres not enough to consider on Nov. 5 the citys residents will vote on a ballot measure that proposes taxing the owners of buildings of 15000 square feet or larger based on the amount of natural gas consumed each year. Gas burning in the burner of gas oven iStock If passed Berkeleys proposal would become the first tax in the country to target the use of a specific fuel source for buildings. EXPERTS RIP TRIPLE CROWN OF BAD REGS AS BIDEN ADMIN POSTS GAS STOVE RULE IT DENIED WAS A BAN Proponents of the new tax gathered over 4500 signatures from community members to get their proposal on the ballot. The tax aims to charge large building owners 2.96 for every 100 cubic feet or 100000 BTUs of natural gas that is utilized. The value is based on the citys own calculus of the social cost of carbon a formula estimating damage caused to society by excess greenhouse gas emissions. Berkeley uses a more just and equitable discount rate to measure that cost than either the BidenHarris or Trump administrations numbers their costlier figure is meant to avoid shifting the cost burden of emissions to future generations. Whether Berkeley building owners also see justice and equity in the citys approach to their tax obligations is doubtful. The local building and construction trades council criticized the measure for levying additional costs on businesses in an area already hit by higherthanaverage taxes. And while the measure explicitly prohibits property owners from passing on costs to renters a city report expressed concerns that higher rental costs could ensue either at the time of lease renewal or through adjustments during times of vacancy. BIDEN ADMIN PRESSURED SNOPES TO CHANGE ITS FACTCHECK RATING ON RUMORED GAS STOVE BAN INTERNAL EMAILS SHOW Berkeley has a lot of work to do. Consumers overwhelmingly prefer choices and the performance reliability and cost of natural gas appliances often wins out. Berkeley sparked widespread pushback against the Biden administration for seeking to curtail natural gas stoves hot water heaters furnaces clothes dryers and more. Bidenappointed Consumer Product Safety Commissioner Richard Trumka now under investigation by the House Small Business Committee fanned the flames by telling Bloomberg News that when it comes to natural gas appliances and the potential for indoor air pollutants Any option is on the table. Products that cant be made safe can be banned. DEMS JOIN HOUSE GOPS REBUKE OF BIDEN LNG EXPORT PAUSE WHOLEOFGOVERNMENT ATTACK ON US ENERGY Undercutting Trumkas apparent desire to enter Americans kitchens the World Health Organization subsequently released a sweeping analysis of the health risks of cooking or heating with natural gas compared to other fuels and to electricity. It found no significant association between natural gas and asthma wheezing coughing or breathlessness and a lower risk of bronchitis when compared to electricity. Its conclusions contradicted prior claims of asthma incidence attributable to natural gas. Perhaps another question Americans should ask themselves on Nov. 5 is where former Berkeley resident and current presidential nominee Kamala Harris stands on the issue While no one knows for sure the vice presidents Thanksgiving picture with husband Doug Emhoff posted on X last November offered a potential clue If Kamala and Doug like a good gas stove will the rest of us get to keep ours too Should we plan ahead this Thanksgiving and if the Harris ticket wins the election set an extra place at the table in case Richard Trumka shows up CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Americas ceaseless culture wars will no doubt sort out these questions and so much more. As many already realize however the most realistic way to achieve a sustainable economic future in which U.S. energy use is clean safe reliable and affordable is to maintain access to natural gas as a longterm option. Berkeleys hungry political leaders may have forgotten the lessons of the past few years but most Americans would prefer to leave Natural Gasgate on the back burner where it belongs.

Climate change activists spraypainted two jets orange after breaking into a London airport where they claimed Taylor Swifts luxury plane was parked in video published Thursday. Credit Just Stop Oil A scientist is calling for Americans to cut off air conditioning after refusing to use it for 25 years during the throes of the summer in order to combat climate change. Stan Cox is an Ecosphere Fellow at the Land Institute who also believes the U.S. military is an enemy to mitigating climate change. He wrote a guest essay in the New York Times on Saturday I Swore Off AirConditioning and You Can Too claiming that airconditioning is making our summers even hotter due to climate change. The greenhouse gases created by the roughly 90 percent of American households that own A.C. units mean that running them even in balmy temperatures is making the climate crisis worse Cox wrote. The scientist described drastic steps to stay cool in the summer such as using the lawn sprinkler and spending most summer days on the porch in the park or anywhere else beyond the sweltering heat of his home. ELON MUSK SLAMS NEW YORK TIMES WRITER FOR CALLING THE CONSTITUTION DANGEROUS Climate Scientist Stan Cox called for Americans to stop using air conditioning in the summer months in order to combat climate change. iStock When it gets too hot we lightly spray water on our arms legs and faces the water helps dissipate a lot of heat. A quick cold shower or a little time spent with that allAmerican favorite the lawn sprinkler also can bring relief he said. Cox and his wife rely on electric fans which he says are free of the refrigerants that amplify airconditionings contribution to global warming. In addition to cutting AC Cox minimizes the use of appliances that can contribute to the heat. We also kept other appliances and devices turned off as much as possible because they too generate heat. Dishwashers are double trouble putting out heat and humidity. We dont have one he said.

You cant unplug the refrigerator of course but we keep ours set for just under 40 degrees he said. For those who might say its a drastic step thats too far Cox believes that theyll get used to living without AC. Our species evolved biologically and culturally under wildly varying climatic conditions and we havent lost that ability to adapt. Research suggests that when we spend more time in warm or hot summer weather we can start feeling comfortable at temperatures that once felt insufferable. Thats the key to reducing dependence on airconditioning The less you use it the easier it is to live without it he said.

But as Democrats became more outspoken on the environment conservative environmentalists say Republicans faded into the background. They want to change that. Growing up as a conservative who also deeply cared about nature Chris Barnard found it strange that only the left seemed to talk about the environment. But if you look at conservative history on environmentalism on conservation there was such a strong and rich legacy Barnard now the president of the American Conservation Coalition told Fox News Digital. As the modern left dominates the green movement with what Barnard deemed apocalyptic outlooks and disastrous policy proposals he and other rightleaning environmentalists are pushing the GOP to reembrace its conservationist roots. Conservation and conservatism are two sides of the same coin Barnard said. And we know that the original conservationists are hunters and farmers and ranchers and people that live on the land and that have such a direct personal relationship to the land. REPUBLICANS RISK LOSING A GENERATION AS ENVIRONMENT BECOMES A DEFINING ISSUE FOR YOUNG VOTERS INDEPENDENTS A young Theodore Roosevelt is pictured during a visit to the Badlands of Dakota in 1885 about 16 years before he became president. Roosevelts dedication to preserving millions of acres of public lands earned him the conservation president moniker. Photo by T.W. Ingersoll via Getty Images Republican President Ulysses S. Grant established Yellowstone as the first national park in 1872. Fellow Republican Theodore Roosevelt was known as the conservation president for designating around 230 million acres of public lands as national parks forests monuments and bird and game preserves. President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 and President Ronald Reagan signed the Montreal Protocol a global agreement to reduce production and use of ozonedepleting chemicals. Its really only in the last few decades that the environment has become a more liberal or leftwing issue Barnard said to Fox News Digital. Heather Reams is the president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions CRES a rightof center nonprofit. She started to notice a shift in attitudes toward environmentalism in the late 90s and early 2000s when she was fresh out of college and working on Capitol Hill. It just became like this mantra that we need to change our way of life in a way we hadnt seen before Reams said to Fox News Digital.

There he predicted the global sea level could rise as much as 20 feet in the near future and warned that the U.S. must embrace renewable energy. The Al Gore kind of approach deeply polarized this conversation Barnard said. Partly because I think hes actually misrepresented some of the science and made predictions that didnt come true. A lot of conservatives looked at that and said Well that didnt come true. So why would I believe you on any of the other stuff Barnard added. In a 2009 speech in Denmark he highlighted research claiming a 75 chance that the entire north polar ice cap during some of the summer months could be completely icefree within seven years. While NASA reported in 2022 that Arctic sea ice has been shrinking it has yet to totally disappear in the summer. A representative for Gore did not respond to Fox News Digitals request for comment.

If you acknowledge the climate is changing then you also want big government international government to solve the problem Reams said of the lefts perspective. Thats where we saw a lot of Republicans just say I dont want anything to do with that. As Democrats grew louder on the environment polls showed Republican engagement slipping. Just 14 of Republicans age 55 and older polled by Gallup from 20192022 said they worried a great deal about the environment compared to 40 of Independents and 64 of Democrats in the same age group. A fifth of Republicans ages 3554 said they dont worry about the environment at all the most of any political demographic polled. GREEN NEW DEAL WOULD COST UP TO 93 TRILLION OR 600G PER HOUSEHOLD STUDY SAYS Chris Barnard president of the American Conservation Coalition urged Republicans to stop ignoring voters concerns about the environment and instead advocate for conservative solutions. Fox News Digital Republican politicians Barnard said have largely fallen silent or been outright dismissive. Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly called it a hoax as have lawmakers like Rep. Bob Good RVA. There is no climate crisis. It is a hoax Good said during an impassioned speech against the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 which included 369 billion for climate initiatives. This is the one crisis that even Democrats could create the Virginia Republican continued. Theyve been crying about the climate sky falling for 40 years now predicting the world would end in 12 years. It is a lie. Such rhetoric isnt helpful Barnard argues. A lot of conservatives rightfully look at climate solutions nowadays and are skeptical because they think that its going to make America weaker and its going to make their lives harder Barnard said. But just because we dont like the solutions or we dont like the extremism doesnt mean we can just ignore the fact that there is an issue altogether he added.

The fact is that emissions are going up and that we have the technology to bring them down Reams said arguing that the U.S. is among the cleanest energyproducing countries even when it comes to fossil fuels and other sources vilified by many on the left. CRES embraces an alloftheabove approach meaning greater domestic production of fossil fuels renewable and nuclear energy and mineral mining. She portrayed the problem as more than a matter of climate but a geopolitical game the United States can win if we engage. We need to be using U.S. ingenuity she said. We need to be using U.S. innovation and all of our resources to be competitive in the world. To beat China to beat Russia to stay on top and help developing nations rely on countries like the United States for resources rather than adversarial countries.

Outnumbered panel discusses the vice president facing backlash for changing her tone on various political stances as the HarrisWalz campaign tries to move away from previous support of farleft policies. During Vice President Kamala Harris first interview as the Democratic Partys official nominee for president she insisted her values have not changed pointing to her work to promote the Green New Deal as an example. The most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed Harris told CNNs Dana Bash Thursday. You mentioned the Green New Deal. I have always believed and I have worked on it that the climate crisis is real that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time. But Harris remarks do not align with a statement her campaign put out last week indicating she does not support an electric vehicle mandate a main component of the progressive climate package Harris claims to still support. Similarly her support for metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time also diverges from such a claim. Subsequently news outlet Axios reached out to the Harris campaign last week asking for clarification of the vice presidents position. Yesterday the campaign responded to Axios but declined to comment on the matter. Fox News Digital also reached out to the Harris campaign repeatedly and asked for clarification on how Harris lack of support for electric vehicle mandates is in line with her values particularly when its a policy measure she has promoted more than once. Fox News Digital did not receive a response. FEWER AMERICANS WANT TO BUY AN EV EVEN AS BIDEN PUSHES FOR STRONGESTEVER CLIMATE CHANGE RULES In addition to supporting the Green New Deal which included EV mandates Harris also sponsored a bill during her time as a U.S. senator that sought to create a national zeroemission vehicle standard which would have required all passenger vehicles to be electric by 2040. Meanwhile Harris ran on a platform as a presidential candidate in 2019 that called for mandates to phase out gaspowered vehicles even sooner in 2035. After the BidenHarris ticket won in 2020 Harris also pledged that all new medium and heavyduty vehicles would be zeroemission by 2030. A Tesla charges at an electric vehicle charging station in New York. The American people dont want topdown onesizefitsall energy and climate policies like federal EV mandates said Chris Barnard president of ACC Action the lobbying arm of the American Conservation Coalition a nonprofit environmental advocacy group focused on limited government and conservative approaches to environmental issues. We should pursue an alloftheabove energy dominance strategy that prioritizes affordable reliable and increasingly cleaner energy solutions rooted in American innovation and competition with China. From nuclear energy to permitting reform this energy dominance agenda tackles both environmental and economic concerns to make America the cleanest and most prosperous nation in the world. Barnard added that Harris flipflopping on issues as important as the future of American energy is neither productive nor compelling. HARRIS PUSH FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES SUFFERS ANOTHER BLOW AFTER AUTOMAKER BACKTRACKS UNWANTED AND UNWORKABLE Vice President Kamala Harris Besides shifting her position on electric vehicle mandates Harris has come under fire for similar pivots on issues like the border health care and fracking. For example during Harris first interview as the Democratic nominee on Thursday the vice president insisted she would enforce the law against illegal border crossings. But in the past Harris has said prosecuting migrants for crossing the border illegally was something she was against. During a nationally televised debate amid Harris 2019 run for president she said as much and in 2015 as Californias attorney general Harris told the San Francisco Chronicle that an undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. She also posted the claim on social media. And in a riff with the late Arizona GOP Sen. John McCains daughter Meghan during a 2019 episode of The View Harris reiterated her stance. FOR ELECTION PURPOSES CRITICS BALK AT HARRIS CLAIM SHE WILL ENFORCE OUR LAWS AT SOUTHERN BORDER As Californias attorney general Harris also instructed local law enforcement not to adhere to ICE detainers when they request that someone who has committed a crime and crossed the border illegally be held until they can be taken into custody by federal immigration authorities. As a U.S. senator Harris sought to strip funding from Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE and she has also previously compared ICE to the Ku Klux Klan. Sidebyside of former President Trump Vice President Kamala Harris and the border wall. On health care Harris campaign officials have said the vice president does not support Medicareforall. However Harris has yet to share publicly that she is not in favor of a singlepayer health care system after indicating during a 2019 debate that she would abolish private health care in favor of a governmentrun plan. Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign earlier this week for clarity on Harris position when it comes to health care but did not receive a response. During Harriss CNN interview last week she also argued that she made it clear as the vice presidential nominee in 2020 that she does not wish to ban fracking despite indicating as a presidential nominee in 2019 that she was in favor of banning fracking on federal land. HARRIS CLAIMS SHE MADE CLEAR HER POSITION ON FRACKING IN 2020 TRANSCRIPT SHOWS ANOTHER STORY Politico changed a headline focused on Vice President Harris position on fracking. Harris supporters have responded to GOP criticism slamming Harris for her shifting policy stances by arguing it is a natural evolution that shows she is a good leader and pointing the finger at Trump for his changing position on abortion. This idea that she hasnt been consistent I mean what about Donald Trumps flipflops What about his flipflops on abortion Rep. Ro Khanna DCalif. said on NBC News Meet The Press over the weekend. I think the vice president is consistent on the position on fracking. Its exactly how Joe Biden ran.

The analysis of 4000 climaterelated extreme weather events from flash floods that wash away homes in an instant to slowburning droughts that ruin farms over years found economic damages hit 451bn across the past two years alone. The figures reflect the full cost of extreme weather rather than the share scientists can attribute to climate breakdown. They come as world leaders argue over how much rich countries should pay to help poor countries clean up their economies adapt to a hotter world and deal with the damage done by increasingly violent weather. The data from the past decade shows definitively that climate change is not a future problem said John Denton secretarygeneral of the International Chamber of Commerce ICC which commissioned the report. Major productivity losses from extreme weather events are being felt in the here and now by the real economy. The report found a gradual upward trend in the cost of extreme weather events between 2014 and 2023 with a spike in 2017 when an active hurricane season battered North America. The US suffered the greatest economic losses over the 10year period at 935bn followed by China at 268bn and India at 112bn. Germany Australia France and Brazil all made the top 10. When measured a person small islands such as Saint Martin and the Bahamas saw the greatest losses. Fire water wind and heat have wiped more and more dollars off government balance sheets as the world has grown richer people have settled in disasterprone regions and fossil fuel pollution has baked the planet. But until recent years scientists struggled to estimate the extent of the role that humans played by warping extreme weather events with planetheating gas. Climate breakdown was responsible for more than half of the 68000 heat deaths during the scorching European summer of 2022 a study found last month and doubled the chance of the extreme levels of rainfall that hammered central Europe this September an early attribution study found. In some other cases researchers found only mild effects or did not observe a climate link at all. Ilan Noy a disaster economist at Victoria University of Wellington who was not involved in the ICC study said its numbers align with previous research he had done but cautioned that the underlying data did not capture the full picture. The main caveat is that these numbers actually miss the impact where it truly matters in poor communities and in vulnerable countries. A study Noy cowrote last year estimated the costs of extreme weather attributable to climate breakdown at 143bn a year mostly due to loss of human life but was limited by data gaps particularly in Africa. Sign up to Down to Earth The planets most important stories. Get all the weeks environment news the good the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Most of the impact that is counted is in highincome countries thats where asset values are much higher and where mortality from heatwaves is counted to be much larger said Noy. Clearly the losses of homes and livelihoods in a poor community in poor countries are more devastating in the longer term than losses in wealthy countries where the state is able and willing to assist in recovery. The ICC urged world leaders to act faster to get money to countries that needed help to cut their pollution and to develop in ways that can withstand the shocks of violent weather. Financing climate action in the developing world shouldnt be seen as an act of generosity by the leaders of the worlds richest economies said Denton. Every dollar spent is ultimately an investment in a stronger and more resilient global economy from which we all benefit.", "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/09/california-mountain-fire-destroyed-homes": "Ten people have been injured so far by the Mountain fire which was 17 contained by Saturday morning As firefighting crews continued to battle the Mountain fire on Saturday some residents were allowed to return to areas destroyed by the blaze to sift through the destruction to their homes. As of 7am Pacific time on Saturday the fire had been 17 contained according to Cal Fire the states wildfirefighting agency. As of Friday 10 people had been injured from the fires according to the Ventura county sheriff James Fryhoff the Associated Press reported. Most of the injuries were from smoke inhalation he said. In a situation update on Saturday Cal Fire said Weather conditions last night remained favorable with temperatures in the upper 40s to lower 50s with a light offshore flow that stayed around 10mph. Decreasing winds continue to assist crews with their aggressive fire attack. Terrain in some areas continue to be a challenge. They agency added Threats remain to critical infrastructure highways and communities while active fire continues to burn within islands of unburned fuel. But before fleeing a wildfire comes a decision what to save. It often comes down to the smallest things Dawn Deleon told ABC7 news. The Mountain fire destroyed her house in Ventura county California this week. Cats dogs and horses. Family photos and SD cards and mementos. A single bag of clothes. Its a choice becoming ever more common as the humancaused climate crisis adds fuel to the destructive wrath of wildfires around the world especially in already fireprone landscapes like southern California with its strong Santa Ana winds that rustle flameadapted vegetation. The power of fire is evident. Palm trees turn to silhouettes against a raging orange wall. Firefighters push a vintage car through a haze of smoke. A woman clutches a scarf to her masked face as she leads her horse away from a burning hillside. Towering blazes strip homes to their foundations. Its never a question of if but rather when and how big when it comes to wildfires in southern California said Alex Hall director of UCLAs Center for Climate Science. He called the impact on lives livelihoods and ecosystems truly devastating. The flames forgive little. Lucky residents escape with their lives and the few things that matter most. The unlucky lose the irreplaceable. Often residents must return to sift through ash and rubble. Every now and then comes a surprising remnant like a teapot with the word blessed in sootcovered cursive. With thousands of residents forced to evacuate some have also struggled to evacuate their horses. Speaking to KTLA equestrian trainer Robyn Fisher said that she started driving towards an equestrian facility to help evacuate stranded horses in Somis a community in Ventura county that has been among the hardest hit by the fire. Upon arriving at the facility Fisher and her assistant found it already ablaze. We got there and loaded the horses as fast as we could Fisher told the outlet adding You couldnt see anything There was fire all around us. You could feel the truck completely heat up. After unloading the first group of horses to safety Fisher drove back to help other horse owners. Recalling the scene to KTLA Fisher said she saw some animals tied to trees while others walked alongside their owners on the side of the road. I stopped and said Do you guys need help And they said Please we dont know what to do she told the outlet. Speaking to the Associated Press resident Kelly Barton said that her parents 20yearold retirement home in Camarillo completely burned down. This was their forever retirement home Barton told the outlet adding Now in their 70s they have to start over. One of her fathers vintage cars a Chevy Nova he had owned since he was 18 years old was burned to toast Barton said the Associated Press reports. Firefighters recovered two safes and Bartons parents collection of vintage door knockers.", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/10/whos-who-at-cop29-the-world-leaders-and-others-who-will-attend": "Crucial question for summit will be how to help developing countries cope with extreme weather caused by high temperatures Cop29 officially opens on Monday 11 November in Baku Azerbaijan and the conference is scheduled to end on 22 November although it is likely to run later. World leaders about 100 have said they will turn up are expected in the first three days and after that the crunch negotiations will be carried on by their representatives mostly environment ministers or other highranking officials. The crucial question for the summit is climate finance. Developing countries want assurances that trillions will flow to them in the next decade to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with the rapidly receding hope of limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels and to enable them to cope with the increasingly evident extreme weather that rising temperatures are driving. The autocratic president of Azerbaijan since 2003 Ilham Aliyev has used Azerbaijans oil wealth to gain international influence for his small country as well as to enrich his own family. Aliyev is the son of Heydar Aliyev a national leader when the country was part of the Soviet bloc who regained power in a 1993 after the countrys first free postSoviet elections the year before. Azerbaijan is rated as one of the worlds most corrupt regimes by Transparency International with a poor record on human rights. Freedom of expression is limited the media are shackled and campaigners have raised concerns over a number of prisoners held since the conflict with Armenia. Aliyev is likely to shrug off such criticism and focus instead on his plans to generate and export renewable energy and attempts to clean up the Caspian Sea. The presidentdesignate of Cop29 is Azerbaijans minister for ecology and natural resources. Like his predecessor Sultan Al Jaber who presided over last years Cop28 in Dubai Babayev has a background in the oil industry. He worked for Socar the countrys national oil company from 1994 to 2018 before his ministerial appointment. Babayev an affable and competent figure is well regarded among developing and developed countries at the talks though he was little known before Azerbaijans surprise decision to take on the hosting of Cop29. Choosing the host nation was a troubled process only resolved at the last moment during last years Cop28. This year is the turn of the postSoviet bloc to host and several eastern European EU members including Romania Bulgaria and Poland had expressed an interest. All were vetoed by Russias president Vladimir Putin angered by the EUs response to his invasion of Ukraine. Azerbaijan was regarded as an outside possibility because of the conflict with Armenia that has rumbled on through two decades flaring into outright war last September before subsiding into an uneasy de facto truce. But just as the organisers were preparing emergency plans to host the Cop at one of the UNs campuses Putin indicated he would allow the choice and Armenia supported the bid leaving Azerbaijans president to make Babayev the obvious appointment. He will be assisted by Yalchin Rafijev the deputy foreign minister with a background in diplomacy who is chief negotiator and the key point of contact for delegations. At last years Cop28 summit in Dubai nations made a historic agreement to transition away from fossil fuels. It was a weaker commitment than the fullblooded phaseout of fossil fuels that many countries and activists wanted but astonishingly it represented the first time that these three decades of talks have produced a commitment to tackle the root cause of the climate crisis. The promise was largely the work of the Cop29 president the United Arab Emirates minister Sultan Al Jaber. A charismatic figure who is also chief of the UAEs national oil company Adnoc Al Jaber dominated the Dubai conference and helped bring Saudi Arabia to the table. That will not be the last of his influence. After Cop28 Al Jaber also masterminded continued influence over the process by helping to institute a new troika system for Cops whereby the current Cop presidency is joined by the immediate past presidency and the designated next presidency to provide a degree of continuity that should safeguard progress made at previous Cops and strengthen future commitments. There were high hopes that Cop29 would be galvanised by the presence of Luiz Incio Lula da Silva whose outspoken espousal of a billionaire tax has endeared him to activists and vulnerable countries. But he is unlikely to make it so his place is most likely to be taken by environment and climate minister Marina Silva. Brazil occupies at key position at Cop29 as the prospective president of Cop30. Next year at Belem in the Amazon countries must arrive with fresh national plans known as nationally determined contributions NDCs enforcing more stringent cuts to greenhouse gas emissions than they have yet promised. These must be in line with the globally accepted aim of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. Brazil as the third member of the troika will want to use Cop29 to chivvy laggard governments to present their NDCs as early as possible. Technically the deadline is February but many countries are likely to see Cop30 itself as the de facto deadline. The UN secretary general is probably the most outspoken senior figure on the world stage on the climate crisis. He has talked of humanity committing collective suicide and has targeted fossil fuel companies who have humanity by the throat. Amid rapidly rising temperatures he memorably warned that we are understating the seriousness of the crisis The era of global warming has ended the era of global boiling has arrived. Guterres will champion developing nations at Cop29 encouraging and berating rich countries into providing more climate finance. He is likely to be equally outspoken to leaders of countries with high emissions and inadequate reduction plans and most of all to the fossil fuel executives who are expected to turn up in large numbers as many multinational oil and gas companies including BP and Shell have strong interests in Azerbaijan. Climaterelated disaster struck close to home this year for the UNs climate chief. Simon Stiell is executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change the treaty under which this conference of the parties Cop is held and comes from the island of Carriacou in Grenada. It was hit by Hurricane Beryl in July. Stiell spoke movingly from the site of his grandmothers house utterly destroyed in the disaster. What Im seeing on my home island Carriacou must not become humanitys new normal he said. If governments everywhere dont step up 8 billion people will be facing this blunt force trauma headon on a continuous basis. We need climate action back at the top of political agendas. Stiells job at Cop29 will be to work closely with the Azerbaijani presidency acting as an honest broker to all 198 parties and guiding an agreement through the complexities of the UNFCCC process. The prime minister of Barbados under whom the country removed the British crown as head of state to become a fully fledged republic has been an electrifying presence at recent Cops and her mission to force the restructuring of international financial institutions has already borne fruit with the new World Bank president Ajay Banga promising to take a more active role in climate finance. Mottley wants to go much further and secure the flow of trillions of dollars of investment each year to the developing world to transform the global economy and provide protection for those most at risk of climate disaster. She has forged close ties with the French president Emmanuel Macron who held a climate finance summit last year and with the Kenyan president William Ruto. With Cop29 focused on climate finance she will be a linchpin for developing countries seeking climate justice in the face of inaction by the worst greenhouse gas emitters. With climate finance top of the Cop29 agenda the World Bank president Ajay Banga is in pole position to make a difference. But will he order the sweeping reforms to the banks practices that developing countries say are needed The World Bank held its annual autumn meetings last month but there was little progress on climate finance. The group is awaiting a pledging conference next month where developed countries must increase the amount of money they are prepared to put towards developing country finance. Focusing on that may mean that Banga has little to offer at Cop29 but that will not satisfy his critics. Joe Biden is not expected to attend Cop29 nor will his successor Donald Trump. During his last presidency Trump withdrew the US from the Paris agreement and he is likely to do so again. However the delegation for the US at Cop29 will be from the Biden White House as Trump will not take office until January. The lame duck delegation can still participate in the negotiations and though they will not be able to bind the US government to clear future financial commitments they are unlikely to stand in the way of agreement by other countries meaning that the core decisions expected to made at Cop29 on finance can still go ahead. The EU delegation to Cop29 will be rather a skeleton staff this year as key figures such as Teresa Ribera the former Spanish environment minister who has played a galvanising role in recent Cops and is relishing the prospect of a new role as vicepresident of the European Commission and Dan Jorgensen former Danish environment minister and another Cop veteran who will be the new EU energy and housing chief are undergoing their confirmation processes which will not be completed until a vote in the EU parliament on 1 December. Hoekstra who served as climate commissioner in the last iteration of the commission and keeps the job for this one is a confirmed participant leading the EU negotiations for the second week of the talks. He faces a big challenge the EU is the biggest provider of climate finance around the world but a rightward slant to the new parliament and among some member state governments may cut down on the blocs freedom to manoeuvre at the talks. Cop29 will be the first proper outing for the new Chinese climate envoy. His predecessor Xie Zhenhua was a key figure at Cops for two decades and enjoyed a cordial relationship with John Kerry the US special presidential envoy for climate. Both retired earlier this year. Liu and his US counterpart Kerrys successor John Podesta have enjoyed some warm meetings this year including one at Podestas home. But even cosy dinners cannot disguise the real tensions between the two powers. China is the worlds biggest emitter of greenhouse gases by a long way responsible for close to a third of global emissions and is also the worlds second biggest economy after the US. Yet China clings to its status as a developing country under the 1992 UNFCCC treaty and has refused to take on obligations to provide finance to the poor world though it does provide such assistance on a voluntary level and under its own terms. China will come under fierce pressure from the EU and the US to make commitments on climate finance and to demonstrate that its emissions will peak soon and fall sharply in the next iteration of its NDC. China and the US will also hold a methane summit during Cop29 at which activists will be hoping for concrete new measures to curb the powerful greenhouse gas rather than the good intentions that have been the only outcomes of previous talks. Cop29 will mark a resonant return to the world stage for Ed Miliband the UKs energy and net zero secretary who played a significant role in salvaging a partial deal from the tumultuous Copenhagen Cop in 2009. In recent years he has attended Cops as an opposition minister wellrespected and listened to with a wide network of international contacts among delegations and Cop veterans. In stark contrast to his Tory predecessors who tended to send junior ministers and not always for the key moments Miliband will take charge of the negotiations himself throughout the conference he will be assisted by Rachel Kyte the newly appointed climate envoy a post that had been scrapped by Rishi Sunak. At last years Cop in Dubai Starmer got his first taste of what leading on the world stage might be like and it clearly had an impact. He used his first speech to his fellow world leaders at the UN general assembly in September to declare the climate crisis a key priority. We are returning the UK to responsible global leadership he said. Because it is right yes absolutely. But also because it is plainly in our selfinterest the threat of climate change is existential and it is happening in the here and now. So we have reset Britains approach. He will come to Cop29 armoured with action he will unveil the UKs NDC expected to promise deep cuts in emissions in an attempt to rally other nations to make similarly bold pledges. A key question he must also answer is how the UK intends to make good on the pledge made under Boris Johnson to spend 11.6bn on climate aid to developing countries by 2026. By the last days of Sunaks government only 45 of the total had been disbursed leaving a heavier burden on Labour to make up the shortfall. Vladimir Putin visited Azerbaijan in August for meetings with Aliyev to underscore the resumption of a relationship that has been tested in the last three years after the Cop host took over the supply of gas to the EU as the bloc tried to cut its dependence on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. Azerbaijan also has its own links to Ukraine. But Azerbaijan only managed to supply the EU so fruitfully by importing Russian gas for its own needs demonstrating the relationship that still exists between the former Soviet pair. Putins August visit was the first in six years. He is still unlikely to make an appearance at Cop29 but the Russian delegation is likely to have more behindthescenes involvement than it usually enjoys. Narendra Modi prime minister of India received a warm personal invitation to the talks by Aliyev. Modi has skipped recent Cops and is viewed as unlikely to attend this one but there is still an outside chance that Aliyevs urging might tempt him. India has taken a trenchant line on climate finance blasting developed countries for failing to do enough and demanding 1tn a year. The country also continues to depend heavily on coal despite a burgeoning renewable energy sector. Other strongmen of the world have also been mooted as potential visitors but few are likely to be among the 100 world leaders coming. Syrias Bashar alAssad was invited to Cop28 in Dubai but did not attend. Nicols Maduro who fraudulently claimed reelection in Venezuela may wish to try to legitimise his presidency by coming to enjoy the company of his fellow oil producers.", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/battery-powered-electric-vehicle-sales-plunge-by-25-as-australian-drivers-choose-hybrid-models": "Australian Automobile Association analysis notes hybrids are exempt from fringe benefits tax until 1 April 2025 Batterypowered electric vehicle sales fell sharply last quarter and may have temporarily peaked as consumers turn to hybrid models that attract tax concessions according to new analysis. Quarterly vehicle sales data released by the Australian Automobile Association on Monday reveals petrolpowered cars continued to decline in popularity with sales falling by 9.16 in the three months to 30 September. During this same period electric vehicle sales declined by 25 from 25353 to 18990 with market share falling from 8.10 to 6.57 the lowest since 2022. According to the AAA hybrid sales increased from 46727 to 48282 a 3.3 jump to a total 16.70 market share. While plugin hybrids which have a battery that can be charged externally to limit reliance on petrol increased by 56 taking the market share to 2.5. Sign up for Guardian Australias breaking news email There have been significant quarterly fluctuations over the past seven quarters but sales figures over that period confirm a clear trend of growth for hybrids while battery electric vehicle market share appears to have peaked for now the AAA analysis said. In the first half of 2023 battery electric vehicles outsold hybrids but since then hybrids have outsold battery electric vehicles in five consecutive quarters. Hybrids are now outselling battery electric vehicles even in the ACT which has long been Australias strongest market. The analysis noted plugin hybrids were exempt from fringe benefits tax until 1 April 2025 which could save consumers thousands of dollars on new cars under a novated lease. Many jurisdictions still offer stamp duty and registration discounts for battery electric vehicles but government rebates for these purchases have now ceased in all states and territories except Western Australia it said. That state had the lowest September 2024 quarter decline in battery electric vehicle market share among all jurisdictions 0.58 compared to 1.53 nationally. The analysis found medium SUVs remained the most popular cars on the market with 73111 sold in the third quarter. Half of these sales were petrolpowered cars almost a third were hybrids 8 were plugin hybrids and another 8 were electric.

But the share of petrolpowered people mover sales dropped from 97.6 to 89.1 thanks to new models. After releasing a hybrid model in mid2024 Kia accounted for the bulk of September quarter hybrid people mover sales the AAA report said. Lexus also offers a hybrid people mover released in December 2023 but this is a lowselling luxury model. In September the cheapest electric vehicle on the market was 31000 after MG cut the price of its entrylevel MG4 hatchback. At the time Polestar Australias managing director Scott Maynard said Australias highend electric car market was restrained by the 33 tax on highend cars and greater competition could be unlocked if the federal government removed it. Aman Gaur head of legal policy and advocacy at the Electric Vehicle Council has said he expects sales of purely battery electric vehicles to rise once the federal governments new vehicle efficiency standard begins to influence the market from next year which should boost local supply.", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/oysters-doing-well-in-firth-of-forth-after-reintroduction-say-experts": "Early signs of success seen in area where native European oysters were fished to local extinction by early 1900s Thousands of oysters released into the Firth of Forth appear to be thriving again after a centurylong absence from the Scottish estuary since they were lost to overfishing. Marine experts from HeriotWatt University who have helped reintroduce about 30000 European flat oysters to the estuary said divers and underwater cameras showed they were doing well. The Firth of Forth was once home to one of the largest native European oyster reefs in the northeast Atlantic yielding up to 30 million oysters a year during the 1800s but by the beginning of the 1900s they had been fished to local extinction. Those reintroduced through the Restoration Forth project which is also planting 4 hectares of seagrass have so far had an 85 survival rate. Naomi Arnold the Restoration Forth project manager from WWF Scotland said they were delighted by the early signs of success. This is down to the hard work of not only the staff involved but the hundreds of volunteers who have turned out in all weathers to help us prepare the oysters for deployment and to physically put them in the water she said. This is a key milestone in our project. With this success and the amount we have learned things are looking very positive for future restoration in the area. Since September last year about 30000 oysters have been reintroduced at four sites that are being monitored regularly. Edinburgh Shoreline Fife Coast and Countryside Trust the Marine Conservation Society Project Seagrass and the WWF are among those involved in the project. It has been 100 years since oysters were last present in the estuary. Oysters from the Forth were once transported across the UK and Europe both for consumption and to restock beds elsewhere. But the pressure of this activity led to the complete collapse of the reefs in the estuary and the oysters disappeared. Naomi Kennon a HeriotWatt research associate for the project said Over the next year we hope to see these oysters continue to thrive and to start to enhance the biodiversity on the seabed. Oysters enhance water quality through filter feeding store carbon and enhance biodiversity by creating a complex habitat providing homes and shelter for countless other organisms.

When you purchase through links on our site we may earn an affiliate commission. Heres how it works. As humans alter the planets climate and ecosystems scientists are looking to Earths history to help predict what may unfold from climate change. To this end massive ice structures like glaciers serve as natures freezers archiving detailed records of past climates and ecosystems including viruses. We are a team of microbiologists and paleoclimatologists that studies ancient microorganisms including viruses preserved within glacier ice. Along with our colleagues Lonnie Thompson Virginia Rich and other researchers at the Ice Core Paleoclimatology group at The Ohio State University we investigate interactions between viruses and their environment archived in ice cores from the Guliya Glacier on the Tibetan Plateau. By linking the genomes of ancient viral communities to specific climate conditions preserved in glacier ice our newly published research offers insights into how these viruses have adapted to Earths shifting climate over the past 41000 years. We primarily used metagenomes collections of genomes that capture the total genetic content of all microorganisms present in environmental samples to reconstruct viral genomes from nine distinct time intervals within the Guliya ice core. These time horizons span three major coldtowarm cycles providing a unique opportunity to observe how viral communities have changed in response to different climatic conditions. Through our analyses we recovered the genomes of the equivalent of 1705 virus species expanding known glacierpreserved ancient viruses more than fiftyfold. Only about onefourth of the viral species we found shared specieslevel similarities with any of the viruses identified in nearly 1000 metagenomes previously captured in global datasets. Most of these overlapping species were also from the Tibetan Plateau. This suggests that at least some viruses preserved in the Guliya Glacier originated locally in the region but it also spoke to the relative lack of glacial viruses in available databases. Using these new reference genomes we attempted to read their stories. Get the worlds most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Related Some viruses have a mysterious Z genome One key finding was that viral communities varied significantly between cold and warm climatic periods. The most distinct community of viral species on the glacier appeared about 11500 years ago coinciding with the major transition from the Last Glacial Stage to the Holocene. This suggests that the unique climate conditions during cold and warm periods profoundly influenced the composition of viral communities. We hypothesize that these influences were likely due to viruses from other places being blown in by changing wind patterns and subject to selection pressures from changing temperatures on the glacier. Digging deeper we next determined how viruses interacted with their hosts. To do this we used computer models to compare viral genomes with the genomes of other microbes also found in this environment. We found that viruses consistently infected Flavobacterium a lineage of bacteria commonly found in glacier environments. We also learned that viruses on the Guliya Glacier must steal genes from their hosts to manipulate their metabolisms. Encoded within the viral genomes were 50 auxiliary metabolic genes related to metabolism including the synthesis and breakdown of vitamins amino acids and carbohydrates. Some of these genes were abundant across all nine time intervals studied suggesting that they help microbial hosts cope with the harsh conditions on glacier surfaces and thereby improve viral fitness. Thus viruses not only infect and kill cells but they likely also alter the fitness of their hosts during infection in turn influencing their capacity to survive in the extreme conditions of glacier environments. Our findings offer a novel perspective on how life in the form of viruses has responded to climatic changes over tens of thousands of years. Ancient neverbeforeseen viruses discovered locked up in Tibetan glacier 25 things found frozen in Europes mountain ice Glacier blood could be key to understanding impacts of climate change Understanding these ancient interactions provides a unique opportunity for future research in both virology and climate science. By studying how ancient viruses responded to past climate changes researchers can gain valuable insights into how viruses adapt to ongoing global climate change. We believe that glacier ice by capturing information on microorganisms and their ecosystems over time in each layer remains a critical resource for unraveling the history of Earths climate and the life it has supported especially as glacier ice reserves rapidly diminish.

South America is experiencing recordbreaking fires which have led to black rain green rivers and hazardous air pollution almost 50 times higher than the level recommended by the World Health Organization according to the air quality monitoring company IQair. Between Jan. 1 and Sept. 16 the continent recorded 364485 forest fires surpassing the 2007 record of 345322 fires according to data from the Brazilian Space Research Institute and Reuters. The historic drought in the Amazon has worsened the spread of the fires. Many of the fires have been attributed to human activity but the drought has created favorable conditions for their rapid spread. As a result 60 of Brazils territory is currently affected by smoke. Including neighboring countries and the Atlantic Ocean the area impacted by the toxic cloud now spans 4 million square miles 10 million square kilometers an area larger than the entire United States. The air quality in Brazil has never been worse Alessandra Fidelis a researcher at the Plant Ecology Laboratory of the State University of So Paulo told Live Science. Natalia Gil an atmospheric science expert and member of the Air Quality and Emissions Department at the Technological Laboratory of Uruguay told Live Science there has been a progressive decline in air quality in cities across southern Brazil northern Argentina Bolivia Paraguay and northeastern Uruguay.

In recent weeks Gil observed a significant increase in black carbon particulate matter and gases such as ozone nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide in cities as farflung as Buenos Aires So Paulo Londrina Rio de Janeiro Cochabamba and La Paz. In Uruguays capital Montevideo residents experienced poor visibility for several days due to the dense smoke cloud and black rain precipitation that turns dark due to the mixture of ash and soot recorded in multiple parts of the country. The same situation occurred across 11 Argentine provinces including the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires. In So Paulo meanwhile the Pinheiros River turned emerald green due to an algae bloom triggered by the severe drought. Paulo Saldiva a pathologist and professor at the University of So Paulo School of Medicine compared the smoke produced by burning biomass to cigarette smoke noting that both contain toxic substances that enter the body through the eyes respiratory tract and lungs. In a metropolis like So Paulo for example the level of vehicular and industrial pollution is equivalent to smoking four to five cigarettes daily. However for those exposed to smoke from forest fires over long periods the impact is akin to lighting one cigarette after another Saldiva said. Environmental changes in recent decades along with shifts in land use have significantly altered fire regimes. While Brazil has always experienced dry seasons the average number of consecutive rainless days has increased from 80 to 100 in the last decade indicating a worsening of climaterelated impacts Fidelis noted. The forest is more susceptible to burning even with the reduction in deforestation rates. It has become more flammable Fidelis said. In addition to changes in precipitation rising temperatures soil moisture and carbon dioxide levels can influence the timing extent duration frequency and intensity of fires Luis LpezMrsico a researcher at the Institute of Ecology and Environmental Sciences at the University of the Republic of Uruguay told Live Science.

When you purchase through links on our site we may earn an affiliate commission. Heres how it works. Within a human lifetime concentrations of CO2 in Earths atmosphere could reach levels associated with 19 mass extinctions that have taken place in the last 534 million years new research suggests. By 2100 atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could rise to 800 parts per million by volume ppmv almost double the concentration of roughly 421 ppmv recorded this year if we fail to curb emissions from burning fossil fuels and converting land for agriculture. That would be edging close to the average CO2 concentrations 870 ppmv associated with huge crashes in marine biodiversity over the last 534 million years according to a study published June 22 in the journal Earths Future. These extinction events are preserved in the fossil record allowing scientists to plot how biodiversity and atmospheric CO2 evolved throughout Earths history. The relationship between carbon dioxide in the past and extinction in the past gives us a kind of yardstick that we can apply to the present study author William Jackson Davis a biologist and president of the nonprofit Environmental Studies Institute in Santa Cruz California told Live Science. Related Hidden 36 millionyearlong cycles may fuel biodiversity on Earth ancient rocks reveal Atmospheric CO2 contributes to biodiversity loss via ocean acidification Davis said. The oceans soak up atmospheric carbon dioxide which turns the water more acidic reducing the availability of calcium carbonate ions needed for organisms to build their skeletons and shells. When these effects are strong enough to affect the entire food chain they can lead to mass extinctions. In the new study Davis found that CO2 concentrations oscillate with marine biodiversity in the fossil record. Get the worlds most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. When carbon dioxide goes up extinction goes up and when carbon dioxide goes down extinction goes down he said. Davis then used this relationship to estimate biodiversity loss under current atmospheric conditions. The current concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is 421 ppmv he said. When we plug that into the relationship between biodiversity and concentration of CO2 in the past that corresponds to a biodiversity loss of 6.39. This estimate comes close to the percentage of biodiversity lost in the smallest mass extinction event considered in the study called extinction event 10 which doomed 6.4 of species 132.5 million years ago. This means humans have already caused extinctiongrade biodiversity losses Davis said. Scientists generally define mass extinctions as three quarters of species dying out over short geological time periods in under 2.8 million years. Under this definition five mass extinction events have shaped Earths history with a sixth likely underway. But another 45 peaks in biodiversity loss that can also be considered mass extinctions Davis said. For the study a mass extinction was defined as any peak in biodiversity loss that is flanked by lesser values. By this definition there have been 50 mass extinctions in the last 534 million years ranging from 6.4 to 96 of marine species going extinct. The 6th mass extinction hasnt begun yet study claims but Earth is barreling toward it Scientists just found a hidden 6th mass extinction in Earths ancient past One of Earths biggest mass extinctions caused by rising sea levels in eerie echo of today The results suggest ocean acidification resulting from elevated CO2 concentrations is the immediate kill mechanism of most mass extinctions according to the study. The link between CO2 in the atmosphere global temperature and biodiversity loss is well established Mike Benton a professor of vertebrate paleontology at the University of Bristol in the U.K. told Live Science in an email. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations are currently rising by more than 2 ppmv every year which may trigger a 10 loss in biodiversity over the next few decades Davis said.

When you purchase through links on our site we may earn an affiliate commission. Heres how it works. Antarcticas Doomsday Glacier is melting significantly faster than scientists previously thought thanks to warm ocean water that is infiltrating miles beneath its surface a new study has found. The Thwaites Glacier which is nicknamed the Doomsday Glacier because of its potential to massively increase sea levels is located in West Antarctica and is roughly the size of Florida. Previous research found that the glacier has been melting rapidly since the 1980s contributing to a 4 rise in global sea levels with the loss of hundreds of billions of tons of ice. If the glacier completely melted it could raise sea levels by as much as 2 feet 60 centimeters. However Thwaites Glacier also impacts sea levels because it acts as a natural dam preventing the surrounding ice of West Antarctica from sliding into the ocean. If the glacier were to collapse completely sea levels could rise by up to 10 feet 3 meters. Yet scientists have struggled to quantify the exact rate of the glaciers melting in part because of the challenges of peering beneath its thick ice. Now new radar data has revealed that warm highpressure seawater has filtered through to the base of the vulnerable glacier. This means that Thwaites risk of melting could be more severe than first thought. The researchers published their findings Monday May 20 in the journal PNAS.

The worry is that we are underestimating the speed that the glacier is changing which would be devastating for coastal communities around the world study coauthor Christine Dow a professor of glaciology at the University of Waterloo Ontario said in a statement. To find out whats going on beneath Thwaites surface the researchers created a highresolution Xray scan of the glacier using satellite radar data collected between March and June 2023. The data showed that the glaciers surface rises and falls by several centimeters as seawater flows in and out below. Worlds biggest iceberg 3 times the size of New York City is finally escaping Antarctica after being trapped for almost 40 years Collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet is unavoidable study finds Ghost of ancient rivercarved landscape discovered beneath Antarctica The picture they produced revealed that as the daily tides ebb and flow from the glacier warm seawater is sent deep inside the glacier for many miles. These inflows act to progressively melt Thwaites from the underside producing fresh water that is washed out into the ocean as the tide retreats. The researchers say this vigorous melting could contribute to significant sea level rise as well as push the glacier further toward collapse. But quantifying the levels of these rises and how close the point of no return is requires more research. At the moment we dont have enough information to say one way or the other how much time there is before the ocean water intrusion is irreversible Dow said. By improving the models and focusing our research on these critical glaciers we will try to get these numbers at least pinned down for decades versus centuries.

When you purchase through links on our site we may earn an affiliate commission. Heres how it works. Winter is still weeks away but meteorologists are already talking about a snowy winter ahead in the southern Rockies and the Sierra Nevada. They anticipate more storms in the U.S. South and Northeast and warmer drier conditions across the already dry Pacific Northwest and the upper Midwest. One phrase comes up repeatedly with these projections a strong El Nio is coming. It sounds ominous. But what does that actually mean We asked Aaron Levine an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington whose research focuses on El Nio. During a normal year the warmest sea surface temperatures are in the western Pacific and the Indian Ocean in whats known as the IndoWestern Pacific warm pool. But every few years the trade winds that blow from east to west weaken allowing that warm water to slosh eastward and pile up along the equator. The warm water causes the air above it to warm and rise fueling precipitation in the central Pacific and shifting atmospheric circulation patterns across the basin. This pattern is known as El Nio and it can affect weather around the world. A strong El Nio in the most basic definition occurs once the average sea surface temperature in the equatorial Pacific is at least 1.5 degrees Celsius 2.7 Fahrenheit warmer than normal. Its measured in an imaginary box along the equator roughly south of Hawaii known as the Nino 3.4 Index. Get the worlds most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. But El Nio is a coupled oceanatmosphere phenomenon and the atmosphere also plays a crucial role. What has been surprising about this years El Nio and still is is that the atmosphere hasnt responded as much as we would have expected based on the rising sea surface temperatures. The 2023 Atlantic hurricane season is a good example. Forecasters often use El Nio as a predictor of wind shear which can tear apart Atlantic hurricanes. But with the atmosphere not responding to the warmer water right away the impact on Atlantic hurricanes was lessened and it turned out to be a busy season. The atmosphere is what transmits El Nios impact. Heat from the warm ocean water causes the air above it to warm and rise which fuels precipitation. That air sinks again over cooler water. The rising and sinking creates giant loops in the atmosphere called the Walker Circulation. When the warm pools water shifts eastward that also shifts where the rising and sinking motions happen. The atmosphere reacts to this change like ripples in a pond when you throw a stone in. These ripples affect the jet stream which steers weather patterns in the U.S. This year in comparison with other large El Nio events such as 198283 199798 and 201516 were not seeing the same change in where the precipitation is happening. Its taking much longer to develop and its not as strong. Part of that presumably is related to the whole tropics being very very warm. But this is still an emerging field of research. How El Nio will change with global warming is a big and open question. El Nio only happens every few years and theres a fair amount of variability between events so just getting a baseline is tough. During a typical El Nio winter the U.S. South and Southwest are cooler and wetter and the Northwest is warmer and drier. The upper Midwest tends to be drier while the Northeast tends to be a little wetter. The likelihood and the intensity generally scale with the strength of the El Nio event. El Nio has traditionally been good for the mountain snowpack in California which the state relies for a large percentage of its water. But it is often not so good for the Pacific Northwest snowpack. The jet stream plays a role in that shift. When the polar jet stream is either displaced very far northward or southward storms that would normally move through Washington or British Columbia are steered to California and Oregon instead. Whether forecasters think a strong El Nio will develop depends on whose forecast model they trust. This past spring the dynamical forecast models were already very confident about the potential for a strong El Nio developing. These are big models that solve basic physics equations starting with current oceanic and atmospheric conditions. However statistical models which use statistical predictors of El Nio calculated from historical observations were less certain. Even in the most recent forecast model outlook the dynamical forecast models were predicting a stronger El Nio than the statistical models were. If you go by just a sea surface temperaturebased El Nio index the forecast is for a fairly strong El Nio. But the indices that incorporate the atmosphere are not responding in the same way. Weve seen atmospheric anomalies as measured by cloud height monitored by satellites or sealevel pressure at monitoring stations on and off in the Pacific since May and June but not in a very robust fashion. Even in September they were nowhere near as large as they were in 1982 in terms of overall magnitude. Well see if the atmosphere catches up by wintertime when El Nio peaks. Often during El Nio events particularly strong El Nio events the sea surface temperature anomalies collapse really quickly during the Northern Hemisphere spring. Almost all end in April or May. One reason is that El Nio sows the seeds of its own demise. When El Nio happens it uses up that warm water and the warm water volume shrinks. Eventually it has eroded its fuel. What is El Nio Will El Nio end the Southwests megadrought El Nio is officially here scientists say The surface can stay warm for a while but once the heat from the subsurface is gone and the trade winds return the El Nio event collapses. At the end of past El Nio events the sea surface anomaly dropped very fast and we saw conditions typically switch to La Nia El Nios cooler opposite.

Tech giants are finding the power needs of AI data centers to be insatiable and nuclear power the only way to keep their servers running. Forbes reports that Amazon has announced three major deals to develop and deploy small modular nuclear reactors SMRs to power its data centers in Virginia Washington and other states. The tech giant has partnered with Dominion Energy Energy Northwest and nuclear startup Xenergy to bring more than 5 gigawatts of new power projects online by 2039 enough electricity to power a midsized city. Amazon Web Services AWS CEO Matt Garman expressed the companys growing confidence in nuclear power as a scalable costeffective and carbonfree solution to meet the ballooning energy needs driven by the rise of AI. Data centers particularly those focused on AI applications consume massive amounts of electricity with AIoriented facilities using around 80 megawatts compared to 32 megawatts for a typical data center. SMRs offer several advantages over traditional nuclear power plants. They are smaller cheaper and faster to build and can be located close to data centers for efficient power delivery. Unlike solar and wind power SMRs provide reliable roundtheclock energy making them ideal for the nonstop operations of data centers and factories. However the technology is still in its early stages with no SMRs currently operating in the United States. Questions remain about their cost and feasibility and the management of radioactive waste remains a concern. Despite these challenges the U.S. Department of Energy projects that nuclear capacity could triple from 100 gigawatts in 2024 to 300 gigawatts by 2050 to meet the demands of decarbonization and continuous power supply. Amazons partnership with Dominion Energy aims to develop an SMR plant near the utilitys existing North Anna power station in Louisa County Virginia close to two of Amazons new 11 billion data center projects. In Washington state Amazon is funding the development and deployment of SMRs with public power agency Energy Northwest using technology from nuclear startup Xenergy. As part of its agreement with Xenergy Amazon is anchoring a 500 million investment in the startup through its Climate Pledge Fund. The two companies plan to bring more than 5 gigawatts of new power projects online across the U.S. by 2039. Xenergy CEO Clay Sell expects the companys first SMR project for Dow Chemical in Texas to come online by the end of the decade with Amazon projects following soon after. Breitbart News reported last month that Microsoft is planning to revive the infamous Three Mile Island nuclear facility to fuel its powersucking AI applications Bloomberg reports that in a move that demonstrates the constantly growing energy demands of AI Microsoft has struck a deal with Constellation Energy the largest US operator of nuclear reactors to resurrect the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. The tech giant has agreed to purchase all the output from the plant which is set to go back into service in 2028 as it seeks to secure a reliable source of carbonfree electricity for its data centers. The 1.6 billion investment by Constellation Energy aims to revive one of the two reactors at the Three Mile Island site which has been dormant since 2019 due to its inability to compete economically. The other reactor at the plant was permanently closed nearly half a century ago following the worst nuclear accident in US history. Read more at Forbes here.

The graduation requirement officially named the Jane Teranes Climate Change Education Requirement JTCCER after a Scripps Institution of Oceanography professor who died in July 2022 was implemented this fall the school announced in a press release. The initiative was designed to ensure that undergraduates across all majors on campus are equipped to understand and address climate change the university said. Over 7000 firstyear students will need to complete a onequarter course from a list approved by the UC San Diego Academic Senate in order to graduate. The program was thoughtfully designed to ensure that approved climate courses align with general education and majorspecific requirements allowing students to meet the mandate without increasing their overall workload school officials said noting that transfer students are exempt but welcome and encouraged to enroll in one of the approved courses. The list of more than 40 approved courses that can fulfill the requirement includes Gender and Climate Justice Indigenous Approaches to Climate Change California Politics and simply Water. While the Scripps Institution of Oceanography offers many of the JTCCER courses others are being offered by arts political science and gender studies professors. UC San Diego has a long history of leadership in climate research and education and the Jane Teranes Climate Change Education Requirement marks a new path forward Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla said in the press release. Whether undergraduates are majoring in STEM the humanities arts social sciences or any other field this requirement will equip them with a strong understanding of climate change and how they can contribute to meaningful solutions. The idea for the climate change courses was introduced in 2022 with Muir College Provost Wayne Yang saying that UC San Diego administration drew inspiration from the schools Diversity Equity and Inclusion DEI requirement implemented in 2011 which mandates that all undergraduates pass at least one approved DEI class. We took the best learnings from the DEI requirement which Jane Teranes was also involved with ensuring that the requirement does not add additional time to degree for students said Yang. The climate requirement incentivizes and encourages faculty to integrate climate change education into their upper division courses and thus deepens the curriculum by focusing on what students can actually do about climate change from their disciplines. Importantly it treats climate change as an interdisciplinary issue. Teranes was among those finalizing the proposal when she suddenly fell ill and passed away leading to the program being named after her. Jane had been an integral part of both getting the idea on the table and then cochairing the workgroup so we quickly reached a consensus to name the requirement in her honor said Scripps professor Sarah Gille. She had a deep understanding of how to teach climate to students and her absence leaves a significant void. This new requirement is just one way of paying tribute to her lasting impact on campus. We set up the new requirement with the best intentions to make sure that UC San Diego produces graduates who are ready to meet the challenges of a changing climate regardless of their field of study Gille added. We need everyone engaged in this work and we hope the JTCCER program will inspire others to follow suit. Please let us know if youre having issues with commenting. Copyright 2024 Breitbart", "https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2024/10/15/europe-on-the-brink-the-debate-about-europes-energy-future-lessons-for-canada/": "On September 9 2024 Mario Draghi the former Italian Prime Minister and former President of the European Central Bank delivered a report to the European Commission offering his recommendations as to how the countries of the European Union could reignite sustainable growth. The report started with a statement of alarm that a wide gap in GDP has opened between the EU and the US and that unless Europe addresses its lagging productivity growth it may fall into an irreversible economic decline. To avoid this fate Draghi recommends that the European Commission take action in three areas. First Europe must refocus its collective efforts on closing the innovation gap with the United States and China especially in advanced technologies. Second Europe must develop and implement a joint plan for decarbonization and competitiveness including directing five per cent of European income i.e. 700 billion Euros per year equivalent to 1050 billion Canadian dollars to fund a public green investment program and other investments. Third it must increase security and reduce dependency notably by forging preferential trade agreements and direct investment with resourcerich nations building up stockpiles in selected critical areas creating industrial partnerships to secure the supply chain of key technologies and increasing defence industrial capacity. Writing on behalf of the Climate Intelligence Foundation CLINTEL Samuel Furfari offered a critique of Draghis proposals with respect to energy policy. He especially challenged Draghi thesis that decarbonization offers a major economic opportunity for Europe. After 45 years of financing by the European Commission and member countries renewable energy sources are still being subsidized either directly or through consumer bills. In fact European countries have provided massive subsidies exceeding 30 million Euros annually in Germany alone to renewable energies. The high energy prices there are undermining the competitiveness of European industries and causing deindustrialization in more and more sectors. Perhaps Draghis strangest contention is that the EUs potential for innovation in socalled clean energy technologies is a competitive advantage. The notion that the EU can outpace China in the renewable energy equipment race through government subsidies is unrealistic. Despite its claim to offer ideas for increased energy security the Draghi report largely ignores oil and natural gas. In 2022 the EU imported 96 of its crude oil 83 of its natural gas and 54 of its coal amounting to a total of 57 of its energy consumption. Much of the supply comes from Russia or Middle Eastern sources that are at risk of supply interruptions. Reducing oil and gas import dependence may be a wise longterm strategy for improving energy security but as these energy sources will be needed for decades at least a prudent approach to security would include increasing domestic supplies and diversifying not ending the sources of imports. In endorsing decarbonization as the way to increased energy security Draghi ignores a key geopolitical consideration. If it switched entirely from hydrocarbons to renewable energy sources the EU would merely shift dependence from multiple oil and gas suppliers to a single source China. How this would enhance European energy security is a mystery. climate change decarbonisationeconomicsgeopoliticsRobert Lyman Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.

The implied story behind the news is that countries like Canada must end their use of reliable and affordable hydrocarbon energy to stop the flooding . Is this true What does the science really say The foremost scientific authority of the United Nations responsible for climaterelated analysis is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC. It is generally regarded by those who advocate for major emissions reductions as the most reliable source and its reports actually written by scientists are generally well respected. The IPCC commissioned a special report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation the SREX which reported in 2021. It assigned low confidence that changes in the magnitude or frequency of floods are occurring at the global scale. This assessment was confirmed by the IPCCs Fifth Assessment Report AR5. The Sixth Assessment Report AR6 of the IPCC is the latest in a series of reports that assess the available scientific information on climate change. AR6 found that peak water flow trends varied significantly by region and lacked statistical significance of an increase or decrease over the globe as a whole. In addition the report stated that evidence of a climate change signal with respect to river flooding is not present for all time frames out to at least 2100. With respect to mean precipitation i.e. average rainfall there is no current signal and such a signal is judged only to emerge before 2100 only under the worst case RSP8.5SSP8.5 scenario. This is what needs to be reported. climate change September 23 2024 at 1119 pm Excellent article. Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.

The results over years of implementation of mass transit LRT lines in Canada do not show a significant level of use or a decline. Many cities are finding it difficult to pay for operation of existing lines how will they pay for additional lines The Green Linehas been touted as part of the climate mitigation action for Calgary.Reducing Greenhouse Gases The Green Linehas been touted as part of the climate mitigation action for Calgary. httpswww.calgary.cagreenlineaboutbenefits.html What is never discussed in relation to mass transit as a means to allegedly cut urban emissions is that the embodied emissions of LRT are enormous far greater than that of conventional carlight truck use in the city. Example It seems that Transit Oriented Development TOD has been an integral part of Calgarys Municipal Development Plan attempting to orchestrate a Building Up form of Urban Planning as per former Mayor Nenshis paper for Canada25 Building Up Making Canadas cities magnets for talent and engines of development versus a Build Out form i.e. suburbs. Again the intention of TOD is allegedly to cut greenhouse gases from car travel by limiting citizen mobility to transit something environmental groups and climate activists are quite adamant about over the other option of expanding the free choice of taxpaying citizens and residents as to where to live whether or not they choose to use a car and how convenient city services will be for them. This begs the question as to whether the CTrainGreen Line of today has been focussed on creating developed properties near it rather than being focussed on providing maximum mass transit access from end to end of the city. It seems that the original LRT lines were not ideologically aligned with climate objectives and were more aligned with serving the maximum number of users and they have served Calgarians well. Are you aware that in order for a city to apply for federal funding the city must use Infrastructure Canadas climate lens which employs the implausible climate scenario known as RCP 8.5 as if the businessasusual case This may be a reason why some aspects of municipal operations or future plans are wildly budgeted cities do not have a choice in this matter if they want federal funding but by using this scenario it skews common sense solutions. We have written to Mayor Gondek about this in the past. At that time we suggested that Consequently we hope that the City of Calgary will point out to its partners in the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and to the federal and provincial governments that it is being forced to comply with a fraudulent representation of our climate future by being coerced into using RCP 8.5 as the businessasusual case when it is far from it. In short RCP 8.5 includes wildly impossible parameters by 2100 such as these plain language These comments are meant as food for thought. Population density is a factor related both to maximized use and tax base to underwrite the costs of mass transit. Many of the worlds best loved cities are often cited as examples of mass transit benefits but let us look at the population density factors. We hope you find this information useful.

Robert Lymans bio can be read here. This article is the third in a series that assesses the costs and benefits of governmental expenditures on municipal transit infrastructure and vehicles in Canada. It will assess the validity of claims that much increased public funding of transit will cause large reductions in greenhouse gas GHG emissions and ensure the attainment of Canadas climate policy goals. The Canadian Urban Transit Association Vision 2040 published in 2009 set out proposed targets for percapita ridership growth by 2040. These targets included a 50 increase in percapita trips in large and medium cities and 100 increase in smaller municipalities. Combined with population growth CUTA projected this would increase trips by 86 by 2040 from those in 2007. In the United States enormous effort has gone into attempting to quantify the GHG emissions generated by transit and other modes of passenger transportation. The Federal Transportation Administration FTA quantifies both direct and indirect transit GHG emissions for each sample project. These direct and indirect emissions are compared to displaced emissions. These are the avoided emissions from reductions in automobile use and the results of improvements in land use efficiency. The latter concept is based upon the view that the increased availability of public transit leads to more compact land use patterns and results i.e. shorter trips increased walking and bike trips and lower rates of car ownership. The American Public Transit Association quantified emissions avoided in the United States through displaced car trips at 16 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year while producing 12 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions for a net change i.e. reduction in emissions of 4 million tonnes. Including the somewhat controversial estimates of transits effects on land use APTA estimated that there were also 30 megatonnes of emission savings almost eight times the benefit from vehicle use displacement alone . APTAs figures thus produce an annual US emissions decrease in 2007 of 34 megatonnes. A reduction of 34 megatonnes would have been 0.56 per cent of the U.S total and 4 megatonnes would have been 0.065 per cent of the U.S total. Unfortunately Transport Canada in its annual reports on transportation in Canada does not provide information comparable to either the FTA or APTA. John Lawson formerly the Chief Economist for Transport Canada in 2012 assessed the implications of shifting passengers between modes assuming that the operating conditions including load factors remained the same. A doubling i.e. 100 increase of transit ridership would transfer 16.25 billion passengerkm from light duty vehicles to transit and reduce emissions by 2.53 megatonnes Mt per year. A doubling of urban transit ridership far exceeds the stretch goals suggested by transit agencies in the past and exceeds even the 86 goal set out in the CUTA Vision for 2040. According to Environment and Climate Change Canada the emissions from all transportation sources in 2022 were 196 Mt and emissions from all sources were 708 Mt.1 So doubling transit ridership at great cost would reduce Canadas transportationrelated emissions by 1.29 and total emissions by 0.36. The National Climate Change Table Process in 1999 failed to produce an estimate of the costs of abatement through transit subsidies. It found only that the cost was likely to exceed 1000 per tonne significantly more than all other options available. Completely eliminating the use of passenger cars and light trucks even if possible would move Canada just over a quarter of the way to the Canadian governments goal of reducing emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2030. It should by now be clear that vast spending on transit can at most play only a very small role in getting to Net Zero by 2050. The spending certainly will have no measurable effect on global emissions temperature or weather. 1 httpswww.canada.caenenvironmentclimatechangeservicesclimatechangegreenhousegasemissionssourcessinksexecutivesummary2019.htmltoc5 climate change mass transit Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.

It classified the potential influences on ridership in four categories the characteristics of the built environment notably population population density and the size of the urban land area transit service attributes notably service frequency and reliability socioeconomic factors notably the age of the riding population the size of the student and recent immigrant populations and car ownership rates and other factors notably temperatures and levels of precipitation. The large number of factors involved implies that the carrying capacity of the transit system in terms of infrastructure and vehicles must be viewed in context and may be a relatively minor factor. The key factors influencing ridership will vary greatly from city to city. The pandemic produced a large reduction in the percentage of people who commute to work by whatever means.1 In October 2022 the numbers commuting were still 7 below prepandemic levels. The statistics on transit ridership in Canada since the mid1990s show four different periods. From the mid1990s to 2014 there was a steady rise in ridership. That trend leveled off from 2014 to 2020. The governmental restrictions implemented following the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic caused a significant reduction in ridership starting in 2020 ridership fell from 1.9 billion trips in 2019 to 849 billion in 2020 and then to 778.4 million in 2021 less than half of the 2019 total. Since 2021 there has been a steady increase so that by December 2023 ridership was back up to 80.5 of the prepandemic levels. However while prepandemic activities have largely resumed and Canadas population has grown by almost two million people there were 426.3 million fewer passenger trips in 2023 compared with 2019. For Canada as a whole of the 15740000 commuters in 2023 83.6 travelled by car truck or van 10.2 travelled by transit and 6.1 travelled by active transportation mainly cycling and walking. The share using transit has actually declined from 11 in 2011 and is close to what it was in 1996. Transit ridership is much lower in smaller cities and in rural areas than in the larger cities. There are too many factors that influence transit ridership to draw definitive conclusions about the main causes of changing ridership. There however is clearly no direct connection between the greatly increased levels of public subsidies to transit systems averaging over 4 billion per year from the federal government alone and the levels of ridership over the past decade. Expenditures are increasing and the population is increasing but the percentage of commuters that use transit is actually declining. From the taxpayers perspective the billions of dollars overspent on transit capital infrastructure is just bad investment of funds that are badly needed elsewhere. 1 httpsbdllde.cawpcontentuploads202211CanadasNewWorkplaceMobilityReportFINALEN.pdf climate change mass transit Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.

According to that paper increased public funding of mass transit systems in Canada would have the potential to double transit ridership by 2035 and cumulatively reduce transportrelated carbon emissions by 65 million tonnes. Only five months later the Trudeau government announced the establishment of the Canada Public Transit Fund CPTF a program that will provide 30 billion over the next ten years and up to 3 billion annually on a permanent basis starting in fiscal year 202627 to enhance and modernize public transit infrastructure. In view of these developments it seems timely to assess the performance of past and present programs intended to achieve emissions reductions through public funding of public transit. Under Canadas Constitution municipalities fall under the jurisdiction of the provincial governments. Until the 1960s municipal transit systems usually centred on buses was mostly provided by privatelyowned companies. As time went on however public transit was taken over by municipal governments. Municipal and then provincial governments took larger and larger roles in the subsidization of local transit systems both in terms of their operating and capital costs. The municipalities and CUTA have successfully lobbied the provincial and federal governments massively to increase the funding of the capital costs of building transit systems. It is now extremely difficult to determine how much has been spent by all three orders of government on transit over the period since 2011. It is likely that the Canadian Unban Transit Association has the data but it does not make it available to the public. The Library of Parliament has published a key background paper that summarizes the federal governments role in infrastructure funding including transit capital funding since 2005. Since 2016 the transfer of revenues from gas taxes plus other subsidies to transit have exceeded 4 billion per year and under the new Canada Public Transit Fund that total will increase to over 5 billion per year. There has been no public accounting to indicate how much of the budgeted funds have actually been spent and no publiclyavailable audit or performance assessment to determine to what extent these various expenditures have actually achieved their objectives. In short the Canadian public is left guessing about what has been spent and what has been achieved. Even less information is available to the public concerning the capital expenditures by provincial governments on public transit. The increased role that the federal government is playing in the funding of the capital requirements of urban transit has opened the door to evermoreintrusive imposition of federal government policy and regulatory requirements that may be far removed from the interests and values of the communities receiving the funds. Environmental lobbyists are already seeking ever more federal funding for transit accompanied by ever more mandatory requirements for changes in Canadians energy use and choices of how to live. Part 2 of this series will explore what effects the muchincreased funding of transit systems has had on transit ridership. En fvrier de cette anne les organisations de dfense de lenvironnement Environmental Defence et quiterre ont copubli un document intitul Putting Wheels on the Bus Unlocking the Potential of Public Transit to Cut Carbon Emissions in Canada. Selon ce document un financement public accru des systmes de transport en commun au Canada aurait le mrite de doubler la frquentation des transports en commun dici 2035 et de rduire cumulativement les missions de carbone lies aux transports de 65 millions de tonnes. peine cinq mois plus tard le gouvernement Trudeau annonait la cration du Fonds du transport en commun du Canada FCTP un programme qui fournira 30 milliards de dollars au cours des dix prochaines annes et jusqu 3 milliards de dollars par an sur une base permanente compter de lexercice 20262027 pour amliorer et moderniser les infrastructures de transport en commun. Compte tenu de ces volutions il semble opportun dvaluer la performance des programmes passs et prsents visant rduire les missions grce au financement public du transport en commun. En vertu de la Constitution canadienne les municipalits relvent de la comptence des gouvernements provinciaux. Jusque dans les annes 1960 les systmes de transport en commun municipaux gnralement centrs sur les bus taient principalement assurs par des entreprises prives. Cependant au fil du temps le transport en commun a t pris en charge par les gouvernements municipaux. Les gouvernements municipaux puis provinciaux ont jou un rle de plus en plus important dans le subventionnement des systmes de transport en commun locaux tant en termes de cots dexploitation que dinvestissement. Les municipalits et lACTU ont russi faire pression massivement sur les gouvernements provincial et fdral pour quils augmentent le financement des cots dinvestissement lis la mise en place de systmes de transport en commun. Il est maintenant extrmement difficile de dterminer combien a t dpens par les trois ordres de gouvernement pour le transport en commun depuis 2011. Il est probable que la Canadian Urban Transit Association possde les donnes mais elle ne les rend pas publiques. La Bibliothque du Parlement a publi un document dinformation cl qui rsume le rle du gouvernement fdral dans le financement des infrastructures y compris le financement des immobilisations dans les transports en commun depuis 2005. Depuis 2016 le transfert des revenus des taxes sur lessence et dautres subventions au transport en commun a dpass 4 milliards de dollars par anne et grce au nouveau Fonds du transport en commun du Canada ce total passera plus de 5 milliards de dollars par anne. Il nexiste pas de comptabilit publique indiquant quelle part des fonds budgtiss a rellement t dpense ni daudit ou dvaluation des performances publiquement disponible pour dterminer dans quelle mesure ces diverses dpenses ont rellement atteint leurs objectifs. Bref le public canadien se demande ce qui a t dpens et ce qui a t ralis. Encore moins dinformations sont accessibles au public concernant les dpenses en capital des gouvernements provinciaux dans le transport en commun.

This seems contrary to your declared Climate Emergency. Likewise media reports where headlines claim that you want Calgary to be at the forefront of the world energy transition defy the facts. As former federal public servant 27 years and diplomat 10 years Robert Lyman retired energy economist has pointed out One of the central premises of climate campaigners is that the whole world is now engaged in a rapid unstoppable energy transition from hydrocarbons to electricity powered by renewable energy. This storyline is endlessly repeated and broadly accepted by the mainstream media in the OECD countries and consequently accepted as beyond question by most members of the public. It provides much of the rationale for claims that countries like Canada should incur billions of dollars in costs to reduce GHG emissions. The facts do not support the claim. In your recent Future Economy.ca video as reported in the Western Standard you make simplistic and unsupportable claims about the alleged energy transition and job creation. The simple math of investing more in clean tech more jobs has not proven out. In 2017 a Smart Prosperity report stated that McKinsey foresees clean innovation in Canadas energy sector as leading to the development of some 60000 new jobs every year from now to 2020. As we pointed out in our report at the time Grounded in Reality this was an astonishing forecast that did not appear to be tied to a specific industry or product particularly considering the rocky state of economies and geopolitics worldwide. The Parliamentary Budget Officer subsequently reported that not even 10000 jobs had been created. In Robert Lymans presentation of last fall When Will Climate Policy Hit the Wall he showed that there has been no national increase in green jobs despite enormous investment of public funds in the order of 100s of billions of dollars. The 1944 scientists and scholars of CLINTEL the international climate intelligence network show that there is no climate emergency in their World Climate Declaration. Thus it is curious that the City of Calgary made such a declaration based on a website out of Australia referenced in your climate emergency plan without due diligence. Cities have no mandate to address climate change under the Municipal Government Act. Longtime climate policy analyst Roger Pielke Jr. recently posted an analysis titled Well always have Paris showing that there has been no decarbonization since the 2015 Paris Agreement See Appendix for illustrative chart Since everything is made from oil natural gas and coal or with the energy derived therefrom the energy industry has significantly profited from the development of clean tech but no decarbonization is going on despite such claims from climate activists. Robert Lyman summarizes the recent Statistical Review of World Energy report which shows there is no world energy transition taking place. Thus you are misleading taxpaying citizens and diverting attention and funds from pressing concerns at home in Calgary. Past administrations spent countless hours of human resources and invested in harebrained climate schemes claiming in 2010 that Calgary by 2020 would offer a prosperous economy for everyone. Clearly the municipal priorities related to mandated municipal duties such as infrastructure maintenance were not given priority as evidenced by the recent catastrophic breaks in the main water feeder. This should be your priority ensuring a safe and substantial water supply for our city of over 1.6 million people and growing. In fact the population of Calgary has risen by approx. 500000 since 2013 approximately a 45 increase Pop 2013 1149000 to 2024 1665000. Your administration signed on to the federal governments Housing Accelerator Fund on March 17 2023. The intention of the federal government plan is to densify neighbourhoods. Despite broad objections by Calgary residentstaxpayers your administration is proceeding. The paltry sum of money offered 228.5 million over the next 2 yrs will not be enough to upgrade necessary infrastructure particularly in older communities these costs will fall on taxpayers. Without additional upgrades existing infrastructure will suffer predictable failures flooding sewage main breaks winter water main breaks. Likewise the densification will pave over more of the surfaces of Calgary which will increase heavy rain runoff and localized flooding. Robert Muir P. Eng. has several slide shows related to these kinds of floodingdensificationpopulation growth issues based on observations in Ontario cities. It does not appear that you have taken such risks and costs into consideration before embarking on the helterskelter housing plan. The Alberta government approved mass timber construction of 12storey buildings on Feb. 8 2020. There is additional documentation in this variance. Recently the city of Vancouver also approved 18 storey mass timber construction and in that council meeting one party suggested such constructions had better fire resistance than conventional buildings. This was disproven in a shocking way on Aug. 06 2024 when a sixstorey mass timber building catastrophically went up in flames. Vancouver was just lucky that ample firefighting and pumper units were nearby and available and that there was no wind. It was widely reported that embers were being lofted into the neighbourhood and as far away as Pacific Spirit Park. This map shows a 0.5km and 1 km radius circles around the fire and arrows indicate prevailing winds. As it was fiery embers from the Dunbar fire were being lofted some 1.5 km away tossed by the convective heat of the flames alone. Imagine this scenario in Calgary if there was a mass timber building fire when a Chinook wind blows in Calgary is already a desertified region on the edge of the Palliser Triangle and at high elevation. With the current water restrictions which may continuereoccur in the future due to other decrepit infrastructure issues or a cyclical period of drought could Calgary Fire Services reasonably address such a conflagration Note also that due to water restrictions Calgarys urban forest of intentionally planted trees and many grassy lawns are no longer green they are an urban wildfire hazard. A further dangerous development is the change in bylaws as Vancouver recently made to allow single stairwell exits on buildings over 6 storeys. We note that Calgary has a plan to continue to reduce water use in the city Calgarys 30in30 Water Efficiency Plan developed in 2005 and updated in 2016 has been a major success and demonstrated our commitment to sustainable water management. Our goal was to hold the amount of water we take from our rivers steady at the amount we were using in 2003 212.5 billion litres despite our growing population. We committed to reducing our water consumption by 30 over 30 years. Calgary made a climate policy of planting trees and intends to expand its urban forest canopy significantly yet it is unclear that sufficient water can be provided for the urban forest on citizens properties even if the city excuses its own watering of cityplanted trees and gardens by using nonpotable water which not all residents have access to in quantity. The municipal tree planting program costs Calgarians a fortune and requires significant ongoing maintenance which includes watering how can you plan to plant more trees and shrubs while continuing to reduce water consumption If watered by city crews with nonpotable water that citizentaxpayers do not have access to this becomes a source of resentment. If unwatered this becomes a public safety hazard. The unwatered citizen plants lawns and trees become a wildfire hazard in the situation we are presently in a potential source of ignition in the event of a house fire especially a mass timber construction fire which based on the Vancouver event appears to be very difficult to contain. Calgary accepted the Housing Accelerator Fund money without doing any due diligence on the related impacts of densification upon existing infrastructure or that fact that the federal governments housing plan promotes mass timber construction as smarter and faster in the original Blueprint for More and Better Housing upon which much of the government plan is built supported by former Bank of CanadaBank of England governor and UN Climate Envoy Mark Carney of Brookfield mass timber was touted as being more climate friendly. We have recently seen in Vancouver that mass timber construction is a higher fire risk which can spread burning embers kilometers away it is unclear if Calgary Fire Services would have the means or the water to put out such a fire certainly with Calgarys unpredictable Chinook winds a regional calamity might result. Thus we suggest a moratorium on mass timber construction in Calgary be imposed certainly until such time as water resources are back to capacity but probably over a longer period of time to allow for a full evaluation by fire officials in Vancouver to determine the cause and regional impact of the Dunbar sixstorey condo mass timber fire. Dr. Ross McKitrick just completed a report for the Fraser Institute wherein he shows that Canadas Emissions Reduction Plan will fail to meet the intended reductions and even if met would only result in 0.007 C reduction in global warming by 2100 that is seven thousandths of a degree Celsius. That assumes these emission cuts were not offset elsewhere. For people who may not be familiar with the technical terms used by economists like Dr. McKitrick Robert Lyman has prepared this plain language version titled At Last The Costs and Benefits of Canadas Climate Plan. Getting to Net Zero will lead to nothing but economic decline burdensome debt for our children energy poverty and deprivation for no beneficial outcome. We invite people to review the historical development of the obsessive climate focus at the City of Calgary by reviewing our past reports and submissions to city hall. Climate ideology is creating bad public policy and putting the safety of Calgary citizens at risk. Mayor Gondek and Council please cancel the Climate Emergency plan and get back to providing reliable municipal services. Sincerely Ron Davison P. Eng.

The cap would help attain governments goal of reducing Canadas emissions to at least 40 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Deloitte the consulting firm was engaged to conduct an economic analysis of the cap. Its report published in March 2024 received very little media coverage. Deloittes analysis proceeded in four stages. Deloitte projected that with ongoing efficiency improvements and ongoing abatement of methane emissions reaching a 75 reduction from 2012 levels by 2040 an ambitious goal and the implementation of already approved CCS projects GHG emissions would decrease from 161 Mt CO2e in 2021 to 157 Mt CO2e in 2030 and 152 Mt CO2e in 2040. Deloitte estimates that CCS projects would need to incur a capital expenditure for capture 1747000 and other costs 427000 for a total of 2184000. These capital costs were halved as a result of the federal government CCS investment tax credit which pays 50 i.e. 663000 in this case of the capture costs and the Alberta Carbon Capture Incentive Program ACCIP which provides a grant covering 12 of the CCS capture capital costs 210000 in this case. Federal and Alberta taxpayers in others words pay subsidies equal to 62 of the capital costs of CCS capture and 50 of all the total capital costs of a CCS project. The net income of a lowcost asset over a 20242040 period is estimated to be 8648 million discounted 4617 million while that of a highcost asset is estimated to be 528 million discounted 401 million. CCS investment entails a negative ROI Return on Investment regardless of the type of oil sands asset. In other words It makes no economic sense for an oil sands company to invest in a CCS project. Deloitte estimates that meeting the cap obligations through production curtailment would mean reducing total Canadian oil production by 626000 barrels per day or about 10 compared to the production in 2030 under businessasusual. Most of this reduction 526000 barrels per day would be in Alberta. Canada also would have to reduce natural gas production by about 2.2 billion cubic feet per day equivalent to a 12 reduction in production under businessasusual in 2030. If production is curtailed as Deloitte projects GDP in Albertas oil and gas sector would be 16.2 billion 20 lower compared to the baseline in 2040. In the rest of Canada GDP in the sector is projected to be 2.7 billion lower by 2040 compared to the baseline. climate change Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.

Robert Lymans bio can be read here. Edmonton City Council has declared that that the city will follow the example of Vancouver and become a 15minute city. Few people know what this means. A serious examination is needed of what a 15minute city would mean for residents and what are its real costs and benefits. According to the 15minute city concept cities would be designed and governed so that most daily necessities and services such as work shopping education healthcare and leisure would be located within a distance reachable by a 15minute walk or bike ride in any part of the city. The inspiration thus arises from three ideas. One is the longheld view of most urban planners that cars and urban sprawl are bad and that increased density will reduce congestion. The second is the thesis that humans are causing catastrophic climate change by their energy use patterns and that eliminating Canadians use of hydrocarbons by 2050 is essential to solve this problem. The third is that government planning zoning infrastructure investments and various regulations are all acceptable ways to alter peoples choices as to where they reside and how they move within cities. To meet all of a households needs would require nearby access to food entertainment education and jobs among other things. Most grocery stores bakeries bars and restaurants are privately owned so their size and location are dependent on market supply and demand for those services. The municipality has no legal means of creating and managing any business or of arbitrarily deciding its location. These are now decided by the market i.e. peoples free choices which already supplies all the food options needed it would not be necessary to call upon municipal governments to make these choices. The same is largely true with the number and location of public kindergarten primary schools and other community services they are linked to the demographics of the population served. People choose freely to work where their best opportunities are. They choose to reside where they can find the optimal tradeoff between the various employment locations of household members the quality of schools the residential environment the housing price and a multitude of other considerations. It is reasonable to assume that people will go on wanting to exercise those choices not to have them constrained by municipal governments. The cities that already have adopted 15minute city policies have restricted or taxed residents access to different areas and imposed taxes and fees to discourage outside the designated areas. Urban planners seem to pursue everhigher density for its own sake and seem to think we do not have enough lend in Canada to accommodate urban growth. In fact the nonurbanized inhabitable land area of Canada is about 864000 square kilometers. Generally experience shows that cities with high densities have more traffic congestion not less. For Canada as a whole of the 15740000 commuters in 2023 83.6 travelled by car truck or van 10.2 travelled by transit and 6.1 by active transportation mainly cycling and walking. The percentage of people commuting by transit still has not recovered to prepandemic levels. Planners desires that people live in everdenser cities go decidedly counter to the demonstrated preferences of the people. Statistics Canada in 2022 published a report on the areas of population growth in Canadas largest cities and with few exceptions it reported that the populations are increasing faster in the suburbs located 20 kilometres or more from the centre than in any other areas. Opposition to the 15minute city concept is not limited to those who champion citizens free choices over the preferences of urban planners. It also includes one of the most prominent of the urban planning theorists alive today. Edward Glaeser is the Chairman of the Economics Department at Harvard University and has published dozens of papers on cities and economic growth. He has characterized the concept of the 15minute city as a dead end which would stop cities from fulfilling their true role as engines of opportunity. climate change citiesglobal warmingRobert Lyman October 17 2024 at 112 pm What if science says the carbon dioxide scare is a scam.

In 2023 the government released a progress report2 updating its policy package and adding some details concerning its implementation. In July 2024 the Fraser Institute published an analysis3 by Professor Ross McKitrick of the University of Guelph of the economic impact and GHG effects of the governments plan through 2030. In fact the analysis does something that the federal government has consistently failed to do offer a coherent and reasonably rigorous assessment of the costs and benefits of the federal climate measures. The Fraser Institute also published a companion twopager4 in which Dr. McKitrick evaluated the governments progress towards the 2030 target in terms of the three key drivers GHG intensity Canadas income and population. As Canada is responsible for only 1.5 of global GHG emissions the federal objective to reduce emissions by 40 would reduce global emissions by 0.6 some or all of which will be offset by increased emissions elsewhere. If Canada achieved the intended emissions reduction and maintained that reduction in future the global average temperature would be reduced by 0.007 degrees C. seven thousandths of a degree Celsius as of 2100 compared to a case in which Canada does nothing. Again this assumes that these emissions cuts would not be offset elsewhere. Dr. McKitrick considers that the government exaggerated the costs of climate change and has presented them in a misleading and overstated way. The government also has overstated the benefits of Canadas emission reductions. Dr. McKitrick analyzed the emissionsreducing effects of the ERP by examining its three components carbon pricing the Clean Fuel Regulations CFR and the various regulatory measures. The total effect of the three components would be a reduction of 26.5. The ERP is projected to cost 6700 per worker annually by 2030. It thus would impose significant economic burdens on Canadian households. The twopagers analysis examines three drivers of GHG emissions using the simple formula Emissions GHG Intensity x Income x Population. Dr. McKitrick states On a compound basis if population grows on average by 1.2 per year and real percapita income grows by 0.7 per year over the nine years from 2022 to 2030 they will contribute an increase of about 19 to Canadas GHG emissions. Hitting the 2030 target of 38 compared to current emissions will require emissions intensity to fall by 57 over nine years A decline of 57 over nine years requires a compound annual average decline of 9.0 more than six times faster than the rate achieved since 2001. Dr. McKitricks analysis indicates that despite the high costs and at best uncertain benefits of federal government climate measures Canada probably will not meet its 2030 emissions reduction target. It remains to be seen whether the federal government will reconsider its present approach and at least establish a revised target that is feasible and more affordable. 1 httpswww.canada.caenservicesenvironmentweatherclimatechangeclimateplanclimateplanoverviewemissionsreduction2030.html 2 httpswww.canada.caenservicesenvironmentweatherclimatechangeclimateplanclimateplanoverviewemissionsreduction20302023progressreport.html 3 httpswww.fraserinstitute.orgstudiescanadasprogresstowardsmeeting2026and2030ghgemissionreductiontargets 4 httpswww.fraserinstitute.orgsitesdefaultfilescanadasprogresstowardsmeeting2026and2030ghgtargets.pdf climate change August 24 2024 at 1106 am Thanks for posting this.

November 2024 At 5 p.m. last Wednesday Germanys 1602 offshore wind turbines in the North and Baltic Seas stood stillsolar output was also near zero. Germany had to scramble to keep supply going. By KlimaNachrichten In the words of Professor Claudia Kemfert It is a myth to believe that solar and wind do not provide enough electricity. The myth that there will be enough wind and sunshine somewhere in Europe was shattered at the beginning of November 2024. Daniel Wetzel describes the situation in the online Die Welt pay article At 5 p.m. on Wednesday solar power was only supplying a single megawatt hour. The 1602 offshore wind turbines in the North and Baltic Seas each one the size of the Eiffel Tower were at a complete standstill. Zero electricity production. The onshore wind turbines produced only 114 megawatt hours at that hour with German electricity consumption at 63000 megawatt hours. Transmission system operator Amprion described the situation on the LinkedIn web portal on Thursday The minimum feedin from wind and PV was just around 100 megawatts in total in the period from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.. This means that the 87000 megawatts of photovoltaic capacity and around 72000 megawatts of wind power installed in Germany with tripledigit billioneuro subsidies were virtually unused for hours on end. There was no danger to the power supply it was said. No sun no wind yesterday and today there was a dark doldrums in Germany explained Amprion on Thursday But our system management had everything under control. Without the fossil power producers and foreign countries things would have looked bad. A situation that was to be expected but was consistently smiled away. Instead graphics of the annual cycle were waved around to show that sun and wind would complement each other perfectly. The fatal thing about the situation is the prices. Fossil power generation has been made politically more expensive and in times of shortage prices really go through the roof. Die Welt added The peak prices of the past week are possibly just a harbinger of what is to be expected in the coming winter. The expert agency Montel quotes energy market experts who expect price peaks of 1000 euros per megawatt hour in the event of further wind lulls. This is because in times of low wind power production increasingly expensive gasfired power plants have to step in which then define the market price level. Traders interviewed by Montel also referred to the German nuclear and coal phaseout which has reduced the base loadcapable power plant capacity that can produce regardless of the weather. The imminent onset of the autumn and winter cold in Europe is also likely to drive up prices. This is because France in particular will then see a sharp increase in its own consumption as many heating systems in the country are powered by electricity. The surge in demand for electricity in France is likely to further increase the relative shortage on the European Power Exchange and thus drive up prices. It takes my breath away that the German people let this crap go on. They need to take some action.

Trumps return to the Oval Office may deal the problemriddled offshore wind industry another blow if his administration follows through on his pledge to scrap federal support for offshore wind projects during his second term. Republican lawmakers opposed to heavily subsidized green energy and commercial fishermen who view the industry as an existential threat to their livelihoods are calling on the presidentelect to follow through on his campaigns promise which could imply ending federal subsidies and lease sales for the industry. RELATED Biden Celebrates Offshore Wind Progress Despite Industrys Major Struggles Cancellations We are going to make sure that offshore wind ends on day one. Im gonna write it out in an executive order Trump told a crowd of his supporters at a campaign rally in Wildwood New Jersey on May 11. Its gonna end on day one. Since January 2021 the BidenHarris administration has approved ten offshore wind projects at commercial scale and conducted six offshore wind lease sales including one held just last week in the Gulf of Maine that was criticized by the commercial fishing industry as part of President Joe Bidens wider climate agenda. Offshore wind has notably suffered from inflation headwinds project cancellations and souring public opinion despite the Biden administrations embrace of the industry. I have no doubt that a second Trump administration will do the right thing for Americans by scrapping the BidenHarris offshore wind agenda Republican New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew a vocal critic of the offshore wind industry told the DCNF. These projects are a burden on our economy harm local communities and are nothing but a political payoff to special interests. President Trump understands that true energy independence and prosperity come from American oil gas solar and especially nuclear energy through a balanced energy policy not from wasteful wind projects that put our economy and environment at risk. I think its a very wise decision Republican Maryland Rep. Andy Harris chairman of the House Freedom Caucus told the DCNF. We are wasting money and the worst part is that all that money is going to foreign wind companies because there are no American wind companies. Theyre all foreign companies that are making billions of dollars off the American energy ratepayer. The Vineyard Wind energy project jointly owned by a Danish investment firm and a Spanish utility earned Republican lawmakers ire in July when debris from one of the projects turbine blades which stretches longer than the Statue of Liberty washed up on Massachusetts beaches after breaking apart and falling into the ocean. Scenes from the fishstewardship flotilla protest at the Vineyard Wind farm today. pic.twitter.comiVFpGHasYd Nantucket Current ACKCurrent August 25 2024 We should never allow foreign owned companies to control our energy supply much less harm our environment while doing it Harris wrote on X. The New England Fishermans Stewardship Association NEFSA a commercial fishing industry group that organized a flotilla protest at the site of the broken Vineyard Wind turbine in August is calling on the Trump administration to walk back on Bidens goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. The group is also advocating for the incoming Trump administration to delist unleased wind energy areas off the coast of New England and the midAtlantic. NEFSA CEO Jerry Leeman told the DCNF that hes optimistic that the Trump administration will be a voice of reason on offshore wind which he claimed would be a welcome departure from the previous administration whom he accused of prioritizing green energy goals over fishermens livelihoods and the health of the marine environment. RELATED Weve Been Steamrolled Fishermen Protest Offshore Wind Following Turbine Failure That Shed Debris Into Atlantic The incoming administration has an historic opportunity to save American workers from foreign developers reinvigorate iconic coastal towns and improve Americas food security NEFSA CEO Jerry Leeman said in a press release following Trumps election win. The Trump administration may also seek to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act subsidies that offshore wind projects are eligible for which could make the industrys continued growth off the Atlantic coast not as economically viable according to Travis Fisher director of energy and environmental policy studies at the Cato Institute. I would expect the prospects of offshore wind to dim once the subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act are repealed Fischer told the DCNF. The high cost of offshore wind is unavoidable. State and federal subsidies can mask the cost by shifting it to the tax base but ultimately either ratepayers or taxpayers will bear the significantly abovemarket cost of offshore wind in the states that mandate it. Offshore wind developers and wind turbine makers stock prices substantially decreased on Wednesday following news of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris defeat the previous night. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request to comment from the DCNF.

Offshore wind like almost all wind and solar projects are pure subsidy mining enterprises. Remove the subsidies and the mandated purchase orders and the projects go away. And save the whales. In the back of my mind Im sure there used to be a group with Save the Whales as a slogan. I think they were called something like Greenpiss. Where are they now Fire up all fossil fuel and nuclear generators build new fossil fuel and nuclear generators. Remove all wind and solar from the grid. Remove all mandates for renewable energy and EVs. Maintain and upgrade the grid. President Biden revoked a key permit for the Keystone Pipeline on his first day in office. President Trump shouldnt have any reservations about pulling the rug out from under the off shore wind industry. Do you suppose that key permit can be reinstated Too late Just wonering. wondering I was wonering what you were wondering How bout a double whammy Reinstate the Keystone pipe line and nix the marine wind mills. IIRC the company that was involved with Keystone has pulled the plug completely and is no longer interested. Since the company had all the necessary permits and had spent real money on the project did they sue for monetary restitution for this arbitrary taking Wind turbines are like having a giant noisy ceiling fan in your living room. The constant low frequency whop whop whopping from wind turbines probably confuses marine mammals who communicate using acoustic signals. Theyre a bad idea for supplying energy and even worse for the environment. I hope President Trump puts the final nail in offshore wind. You know what Maybe the whales are affected by the wind mills and maybe they arent. What is for sure is they are horribly expensive good for nothing boondoggles. When George Orwell wrote Animal Farm he needed a boondoggle that oppressive governments promote in order to create an appearance of progress. Orwell chose the windmill. Wind mills are a 14th century solution to a 21st century nonproblem. Any wind turbine company with even a single braincell must surely know what Trump will do and cease and withdraw forthwith. An immediate executive order then work on laws to make it impossible to ever be considered again. then work on laws to make it impossible to ever be considered again. Hopefully you mean eliminating the subsidies and mandates for wind as opposed to banning it outright. Eliminating subsidies and mandates should effectively ban offshore wind. But I would like to see something that banned offshore wind completely. All this New England wind and solar near the Marcellus and Utica shale gas fields which GreenPeace and Sierra Club have stopped any and all development. That would be a logical start to begin with policy changes. The US east coast wind energy projects were dealt a fatal blow on Election Day 2024. None of the woke States have the resources to waste on these totems to stupidity so the projects are all dead as just the risk of Federal largesse disappearing. California has a credit rating of AA while northeast coastal States pushing wind energy are even lower Australias Woketoria is in a debt trap. The premier went to China seeking investment in offshore wind but the Federal government stopped any direct investment from China. US Federal debt is fuelling western inflation but there is never a problem for the Federal government to keep creating money other than price inflation. But States can end up in a debt trap like any household because they cannot create money. The consequence of Californias debt is loss of one House seat. Hard to see a reversal any time soon.

At a time of political change against climate alarmismforced energy transformation even deep ecologists should question whether CO2 greening is better than wind solar battery industrialization. Greenhouse gas GHG calculations1. Gross GHG Emissions Definition Total emissions generated by an entity such as a country company or individual without accounting for any offsets or sequestration efforts. Example A factory emits 100000 tons of CO annually.2. Net GHG Emissions Definition Emissions after accounting for offsets carbon removal or carbon sequestration e.g. planting trees carbon capture technologies. Formula Net GHG Emissions Gross Emissions Carbon Offsets Carbon Sequestration Example If the same factory invests in reforestation that absorbs 20000 tons of CO its net emissions become 80000 tons.3. Carbon Neutrality Definition Achieving a balance between emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere through offsets. This doesnt require eliminating emissions but offsetting what remains. Achieved through Renewable energy investments Purchasing carbon credits or offsets ExampleA company emits 10000 tons of CO but buys carbon credits from projects that absorb an equivalent amount making it carbonneutral.4. NetZero Emissions Definition Refers to reducing emissions as much as possible and using offsets or removals only for unavoidable emissions. The focus is more on eliminating emissions upfront rather than relying on offsets. Key Principles Longterm permanent reductions are prioritized. Any residual emissions must be balanced with direct removals e.g. through carbon capture and storage. Example A company redesigns operations to cut emissions by 95 and removes the remaining 5 through sequestration.5. Zero Emissions True Zero Definition Achieving no emissions at all from an activity product or process without relying on any form of offsetting. This is technically challenging for most industries. Example An electric vehicle that uses only renewable energy throughout its entire lifecycle could be considered a zeroemission vehicle.6. ScienceBased Targets Definition Reduction targets aligned with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C or 2C. Companies or governments commit to a pathway that includes GHG reduction milestones. Example A company may aim to cut emissions by 50 by 2030 and reach netzero by 2050.7. GHG Protocol Scopes 1 2 and 3 Scope 1 Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources e.g. fuel combustion onsite. Scope 2 Indirect emissions from purchased electricity heat or steam. Scope 3 Indirect emissions from the supply chain and product use.In summary these different approaches to GHG calculations reflect varying levels of ambition and strategies. While carbon neutrality can be achieved through offsets netzero focuses more on eliminating emissions directly with limited reliance on offsets for unavoidable emissions. Zero emissions is the most stringent target aiming to produce no emissions at all. Show me a company increasing its costs and Ill show you a company going out of business. None of the companies in BRICS other industrial nations will be spending a penny on this crap. And I will argue that treating CO2 as both a pollutant and the thermostat is fundamentally misguided. Plant food is hardly dangerous and even if the modest warming is somehow related to CO2 it is coming off the coldest period in this interglacial. Furthermore the effects of CO2 are overstated with the real world effects of doubling the level is less than 1.4C. Plus theres zero evidence model output are not evidence that there is any significant negative effect of this modest warming. 6. ScienceBased Targets Definition Reduction targets aligned with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C or 2C. Companies or governments commit to a pathway that includes GHG reduction milestones. There is nothing about these goals that is sciencebased. Well fake science maybe. There is nothing about these goals that is sciencebased.. Yep I agree. These numbers are a wishful thinking that someone at the UN pulled out of their butt. Excellent chart. Makes thing perfectly clear. You and me too That makes three of us. Zero carbon net zero and carbon neutrality can all take a hike we dont need to do any of it. Its never about saving the planet for leftys but always about their road to serfdom Sell the car Tesla bumper sticker causes a stir online Go get em Trumpy I am lost for words when I see this obsession with carbon. Why do these people keep saying silly things like carbon neutrality can be achieved. What is the point when number of scientific published peer reviewed studies in last few years have shown that CO2 is irrelevant because it does NOT warm the Earths atmosphere Lets forget the useless money gobbling nature destroying and intermittent wind and solar and use coal and gas which are cheap and reliable and reserves of which we have for few hundred years Login Become a WUWT Sponsor click here Free signup if you want to post comments includes ads click here Walk toward the fire.

Spencer Ph. D. NOTE Since he has done extensive investigation into some implausibly hot temperatures reported in Death Valley I asked Bill Reid to comment on my previous blog post where I maintain that the world record 134 deg. F highest recorded air temperature was likely biased warm by about 10 deg. and should not be accepted as a world record. What follows are Bills initial thoughts on the subject. Also based upon his comments I will likely update the charts found in my previous blog post with more realistic temperature lapse rate values in the early 20th Century when insufficient stations were available to determine accurate lapse rates. by William T. Reid A big thank you to Dr. Spencer for investigating the current very dubious world hightemperature record and for bringing attention to my Death Valley climate research. There are a handful of ways both climatologically and meteorologically to show that Greenland Ranchs reported maximum of 134F on July 10 1913 is likely not valid. Dr. Spencers methodology here comparing the Death Valley maximums to those the closest surrounding stations with adjustments for station elevation is indeed a devastating blow to the authenticity of the suspect observations. What it basically demonstrates is that the lower troposphere was not hot enough to support temperatures much above 125F in July 1913. I have compared regional maximums for all of the hottest summertime events since 1911. In practically all instances in which the Greenland Ranch and Death Valley reports appear reasonable ALL of the maximums at the closest surrounding stations lend support to the maximums for Death Valley. From July 7 to 14 of 1913 when eight consecutive afternoons had reported maximums of 127 128 129 134 129 130 131 and 127F in Death Valley NONE of the maximums from the closest surrounding stations supported the Greenland Ranch maximums The departures from average for maximums for the hottest fiveday stretch were about 4 to 8 at the closest stations while maximums at Greenland Ranch were nearly 15 degrees F above the average for July. see table Annual maximums at Greenland Ranch from 1911 to 1960 ranged from 120F to 127F except for the 134F in 1913. If the reported maximums at Greenland Ranch in July 1913 were authentic then the maximums at the closest surrounding stations in that month would have been much higher than reported. In addition numerous regional heat waves have been hotter than the one during the first half of July 1913. Why have Death Valley maximums failed to exceed 130F in the interim when three days in July 1913 purportedly reached 134 130 and 131F In his bias chart Dr. Spencer notes the substantial warm biases in the temperatures reported at Greenland Ranch in the first 1015 years. And he mentions that the observers may have been relying to some extent on thermometers other than the official instrumentation. I do think that the observer was comparing household thermometer readings with the official equipment on occasion from spring to summer of 1913. Higher readings off of the poorlyexposed thermometers near the ranch house and under the veranda were probably and inappropriately entered onto the official climate form. But I have not uncovered much evidence of this particular type of deviation from standard observational procedures outside of 1913. I would contend that the generally higher bias numbers from the early years comparably are due primarily to changes at the closest area weather stations which promoted cooler maximums early on and warmer maximums later. For example two of the closest stations to Greenland Ranch in 1913 were Independence and Lone Pine in Owens Valley. In 1913 Owens River water was diverted to Los Angeles and the Owens Valley gradually dried up. Summer maximums increased as Owens Lake evaporated irrigation was not possible and farmland was abandoned and desertlike conditions developed. Roys note The early years had very few stations within 100 miles of Death Valley and the temperature lapse rates I computed from those few stations appear to be biased as a result. I will correct this in a future blog post and will provide what should be better estimates of average July daily maximum Death Valley temperatures. Also in the early decades of the 20th century thermometer shelters were almost invariably sited above grass. This resulted in very conservative i.e. coolish maximums at desert stations. Low humidities promoted cooling due to evapotranspiration effects. In the early decades of the 20th century desert weather stations were generally in towns amidst shade trees and lawns. The resulting maximum temperature reports were very conservative. By midcentury and thereafter the town weather stations were more likely to be at the airport or at a municipal utility site fire station or equipment yard. Grass cover and shade trees were usually absent at these locales. Today desert weather stations in towns and cities are almost invariably above bare ground. You can imagine the difference in maximums between desert stations above oftirrigated grass and those above bare ground. Roys note In my experience unless the vegetation area is rather large and there is almost no wind a weather stations daily maximum temperature will still be largely determined by air flowing from the largerscale desert surroundings. But note this is different from say a poorly sited thermometer next to a brick wall or heat pump where hot air from an isolated source can elevate the daily maximum temperature recorded. The Greenland Ranch station was originally sited above a patch of alfalfa grass immediately adjacent to forty acres of cultivated and irrigated land. It is my belief that the new observer in 1913 Oscar Denton was rather disillusioned with the conservative maximums from the official station above grass and next to the evaporativelycooled farmland. I think he felt compelled to fudge the maximums upwards in 1913. Photographs of the Greenland Ranch weather station show that it was above bare ground by about 1920 see example photo at top of post. This is more of a comment that many older temperature readings are as suspect as newer readings at airports or near AC condensers. So barring s time machine there is no good way to tell. Apparently Oscar Denton was almost 100 years ahead of his time. If you ever see an image of the writing on the temperature records youd cry its so beautiful. This is the hand of a very meticulous person not the chicken scratchings of some slob. I take that as a sign of character this guy was meticulous in recording the temperature measurements he was likely meticulous in everything. Reid should not be insulting the worker . Is he that liberal Reid has never voted for a Democrat and he was an avid listener to Rush Limbaugh for 30 years. I dont mix climatology with politics. Do you think it is possible that Denton could 1 have nice handwriting and 2 bend the truth now and then One of the things I like about reading Roy Spencers work is that he is open to comments and corrections. I disagree on three points. Go back and compare not the daily highs but the overnight lows and the daily highs. If you notice the night before the night of the 13th the overnight low was about 15 degrees above the mean for overnight lows. I think a cloud layer rolled in blocking heat from escaping water vapor blocks long wave radiation. Independence Lone Pine Tonopah are in completely different environments than Death Valley. Independence and Lone pine are at 3000 elevation Tonopah is 6000 elevation. Compare this to Death Valley at 178 below sea level. Adiabatic Lapse Rate change in temp due to elevation is 5.4F according to the NWS. Theres your 15 degrees change between Independence Lone Pine and Green Valley Ranch. My last point is that modern weather stations are likely to be adjacent to large expanses of asphalt especially at airports. Large airports for heavy aircraft are likely to have tens of feet deep concrete for aircraft parking. Thats a lotta heat sink to cool down every night along with big metal buildings i.e. reflective solar cookers. I want to restate the Adiabatic Lapse Rate is 5.4F per thousand feet elevation change. Lone Pine and Independence being 3000 feet higher than Green Valley Ranch are expected to be 5.4 3 degrees cooler or about 16.2 degrees cooler just due to Adiabatic Lapse Rate. I agree with on this I live in the north Mojave Desert and all of these nearby locations range from somewhat different to totally different to Death Valley See Ron Longs post you have to experience it there is something special about that place As I posted on Part . The Indian Wells Valley had three 119F days in 1988 1993 2021 all in the month of July. The elevation is 2.250 feet thats 2450 higher than Greenland Ranch. The dry air lapse rate its as dry here as DV calcs to 13.2F. On those 119F days 132F in DV if the lapse rate applies. There is nothing you can do to make the past readings more accurate than they were factually written down as. Every adjustment runs the risk of adjusting in the wrong direction. By playing this game you are arguing that the constant cooling off of the past temperatures that the global warming alarmists participate in to the detriment of science. Past temperatures are recorded that is historical and it is the official records. They need to be left alone officially. If you want to play around on the sidelines and make up stories by all means enjoy your stories. Let me run this through the leftist view point. Hey they are using adiabatic lapse rate to adjust past temperatures based on nearby station data. You know let me see how that makes current warming look scarier if I do the same thing on a much wider scale where I always take the lowest temperaturealtitude measurements and bring the rest of the stations in line with that cherry picked station Hey look at that I was about do drop past temperatures by another 2 degrees celsius Hey guys look what I did. Check peer reviewed now it is part of the scientific dataset oh look all my global warming buddies are using my study locking it into place and well looky there global warming has been much more solidly locked in as the scientific truth. Time to get rid of energy It is my belief that the new observer in 1913 Oscar Denton was rather disillusioned with the conservative maximums from the official station above grass and next to the evaporativelycooled farmland. I think he felt compelled to fudge the maximums upwards in 1913. Cant be hotter than today The Met Office makes it up. Using non existent stations. Despite repeated requests for comment the Met Office has remained silent on the matter. What both parts one and two suggest Is something I concluded in 2014 essay When Data Isnt In ebook Blowing Smoke. The historical surface temperature measurements are not fit for climate purpose. There are many ways to show this. Surface Stations showing numerous microsite issues. Heller showing the past was cooled by adjustments. BOM fiddling with pristine Rutherglen Ag Research Station. BEST algorithm fiddling with Amundsen Scott. Scarcity of coverage in South America and Africa. Trade route biased SSTs. This has several big climate consequences. As someone that drove in the summer of1989 from Beatty Nevada to Furnace Creek Death Valley renamed Greenland in a dark blue Blazer with a black Vinyl top as we turned south toward Furnace Creek the motor overheated so bad we turned the air conditioner off and turned the heater on full blast then the dash cracked in half and we only saved ourselves by pouring cold survival fluids over ourselves I can only describe the temperature by remembering the comment from Good Morning Vietnam its hot fool were you born on the sun From the postI think he felt compelled to fudge the maximums upwards in 1913. Accusing a dead person of lying is low. Correct me if Im wrong but wasnt the previous all time record high in Libya A thorough investigation found errors such as siting issues. But the biggie was that compared to surrounding records it was surmised that the new guy recording the temp record the top of the little iron bar instead of the bottom The bottom was the max the mercury in the thermometer the actual high temp for day pushed up the little rod. When the temperature dropped the rod would hang up at the highest temp. So they lowered the Libya temp by the height of the little rod. The 2 record was the Death Valley record. The FASCINATION WITH one hot afternoon in 1913 is very bizarre. There is no way to know how far off the claim is from what would have been measured with modern 2024 instruments. In that heat Id be surprised that anyone would even walk outside to read a thermometer. It would be easier to guess a number. Is the 134 too high Maybe. But so what if is There are plenty of other TMAX records in other nations. Are they all wrong Summer desert TMAX is actually not very important for greenhouse warming which most affects TMIN in colder climates in colder months of the year. AFRICA The hottest temperature ever reliably measured in Africa was 124.3F 51.3C in Ouargla Algeria on July 5 2018. This was the result of a historic heat wave that affected northern Africa. ASIA The hottest temperature ever recorded in Asia was 54 C 129 F on June 29 2017 at Ahvaz Airport in Iran. This temperature was also recorded in Tirat Zvi Israel on June 21 1942. EUROPE The hottest day ever recorded in Europe was August 11 2021 when an automated weather station in Syracuse Sicily recorded a temperature of 48.8C 119.8F. This broke the previous record of 48C 118.4F set in Athens and Elefsina Greece in 1977. SOUTH AMERICA The hottest temperature ever recorded in South America was 48.9C 120F in Rivadavia Argentina on November 12 1905. AUSTRALIA Only one day back in 1960 saw a confirmed reading match that sizzling highmercury mark. Not only does a 50.7C 123.26 Freading stand as Australias hottestever temperature but its also the highest confirmed reading ever observed in the southern hemisphere. ANTARCTICA The hottest day ever recorded in Antarctica was February 6 2020 when the temperature reached 18.3C 64.9F at Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. This broke the previous record of 17.5C 63.5F set at the same location in March 2015. NORTH AMERICA The 134 is controversial and may be overstated. But In July 2023 Death Valley experienced a heat wave and an unofficial reading of 130F was recorded. Jul 12 2021 On Sunday the high temperature at Stovepipe Wells hit 128.6 degrees Fahrenheit 53.7C one of the hottest U.S. temperatures ever measured. How hot is it Good Morning Vietnam Its Damn Hot.mov Cool for other places maybe but the all time recorded high for little spot on the globe Columbus Ohio is 106F set July 14 1934. The previous 4 days also set record highs for those calendar days that same year. Talk about a heat wave I wonder what Furnace Creek hit that day its 200 lower. Ridgecrest hit 119F the day before on the 11th. I asked a question in Part I and no one responded so I will ask it again Would one expect to find the most extreme global temperature fitting nicely along the lapse rate line or would one expect it to be an outlier for unknown reasons What causes the variance found in the lapse rate measurements Is it possible that there was some local factor that isnt found at the higher elevations such as lack of wind in the basin What role does topography play in elevating air temperatures That is do we expect extrema to always compliantly fit on the estimated lapserate regression line or are they more probably extrema precisely because something anomalous is causing them to deviate from their predicted value such as local nocturnal clouds causing the sunrise temperature to be higher than at the proximate stations How can we be sure that the temperatures recorded at the other stations were uniformly of higher quality particularly since Reid has remarked about the city trees and grassy areas under the shelters. I previously remarked about California commonly having NS isotherms during heat waves that parallel the crest of the Sierra Nevada. What happens on the other side what do the isotherms look like Are the stations representative random samples Regardless all I have seen is an argument that provides reasons why the 134 deg record could be wrong. However it is lacking what I would call irrefutable evidence that it is wrong Rather than disavowing the validity perhaps it would be sufficient to just add an asterisk and note that there are reasons to be concerned about the validity as there is for ALL historical records. I spent my senior Summer Field Mapping in the foothills of the White Mountains east of Lone Pine camping in Mazourka Canyon along with 20 other young men. I was there for the the entire month of July in 1969. It was blistering hot every day particularly once the sun came up from behind the crest of the White Mountains about 700 AM. I only wore boots shorts and a hat all day it is probably the reason Ive had some patches of skin cancer removed from my shoulders starting about the time I was 30. What I observed first hand was that despite the assumption of a uniform high pressure system over the area the temperatures varied perceptibly from one day to the next. Therefore how does one rule out the possibility of some local variation actually resulting in a DV temperature actually warmer than in subsequent years Doubt is not the same thing as proof.

At the time they put a cost of 114MWh on CCGT or 54MWh excluding the irrelevant Carbon Cost. I was particularly interested in what the costs would be based on current fuel costs. The spreadsheet they sent me shows they have assumed operating efficiency of 53. In other words to produce 1 MWh of electricity you need to input 1.886 MWh of fuel. Their original costings assumed a natural gas price of 64ptherm in 2025 falling to 56p in 2026 then rising back to 67p by 2049 all at 2021 prices. The levelised costs are based on the cost over the 25year lifetime of the plant. The most recent DESNZ fossil fuel price assumptions published in September list a price next year of 75p then dropping back to 70p. Prices after 2030 are highly subjective and should not really concern us though DESNZ think they will drop further notingthat increasing liquification capacity will put downward pressure on prices Remember these are all presented in real terms at 2023 prices. httpswww.gov.ukgovernmentpublicationsfossilfuelpriceassumptions2024 If we plug in the 75p price for next year we get a fuel cost of 48.29MWh compared to the figure of 43 in the Levelised Cost report. Using 70ptherm which looks to be representative of the next ten years or so that cost drops to 45.07MWh. That would indicate a total cost excl Carbon Cost of about 56MWh. Remember that the operational costs are still costed at 2021 prices but they are small enough to make little difference. It is these sort of costs that we need to be comparing with the known CfD prices for offshore wind currently around 82MWh. Although I have dismissed Carbon Costs as not being a cost as such it is worth noting that the Levelised Cost of 60MWh for carbon implies a Carbon Price of about 174tonne CO2. Curiously the spreadsheet uses 83.03tonne giving a cost of 28.66MWh. Carbon Prices this year have been around 40tonne thus adding about 14MWh to CCGT generation costs. Given that gas power tends to set the wholesale market price of electricity currently around 80MWh that 14 makes a big difference. Put another way if the Carbon Pricing scheme was abolished wholesale prices could potentially drop to 66MWh. I can email the spreadsheet to anybody interested. DESNZ have not allowed for fuel costs when wind and solar are in unreliable mode i.e. 247365 back up Or on the face of it infrastructure costs to move the power from where its generated to where its needed which is often a much greater distance than existing technologies require. When a solar farm was built next to my hood in central Wokeachusetts they needed to upgrade the power line to a main highway. I fail to understand about power lines. For the new lines running through the hood they needed new poles and they needed to cut down many large old pine trees. Just an example on a small scale of the impact to people and their homes. The fleet average efficiency is close on 50 according to the statistics. Chart includes coal and nuclear for comparison. httpsdatawrapper.dwcdn.netBr8Mc2 Peak efficiency will be somewhat higher the best plants might manage over 60 run as baseload but plant operates at reduced efficiency during ramping up and down to accommodate the solar duck curve and variable demand and wind output. What percentage effective utilisation have DESNZ used for solar and wind over their lifetime This will have a large effect on the cost per MWh Correct. I suspect they have failed to allow adequately for rising levels of curtailment as surpluses grow in size and frequency as more capacity is added. These can be highly damaging to output. For example so far in 2024 the fairly new Seagreen wind farm has seen 2.4TWh of curtailment. Thats over 30 of its nominal capacity and around 23rds of its potential output. So the real cost of the actual output in LCOE terms is around 3 times the nominal value. This article is a confusing mess and does not cover the Ato Z picture. . From BATTERIES IN NEW ENGLAND TO COUNTERACT A ONEDAY WINDSOLAR LULL FOR A MERE 456 BILLION httpswww.windtaskforce.orgprofilesblogsbatteriesinnewengland . Levelized Cost of Energy by USEIA Most people have no idea wind and solar systems need grid expansionreinforcement and expensive support systems to exist on the grid. . With increased WS percent on the grid increased grid investments are needed plus greater counteracting plant capacity MW especially when it is windy and sunny. . Increased counteracting of the variable WS output places an increased burden on the grids other generators causing them to operate in an inefficient manner more BtukWh more CO2kWh which adds more costkWh to the offshore wind electricity cost of about 15 ckWh after 50 subsidies . The LCOE adders for below items 2 through 5 are minimal until about 8 WS on the grid and become exponentially greater with increased WS on the grid . At about 25 WS on the grid these four LCOE adders total at least 5 ckWh . The USEIA Lazard Bloomberg etc. and their phony LCOE analyses are deliberately understating the cost of wind solar and battery systems . Their LCOE analyses of WSB systems purposely exclude major LCOE items. Their deceptions reinforced the popular delusion WS are competitive with fossil fuels which is far from reality. The excluded LCOE items are shifted to taxpayers ratepayers and added to government debts. . WS would not exist without at least 50 subsidies WS output could not be physically fed into the grid without the last four items. See list. . 1 Subsidies equivalent to about 50 of project owning and operations cost 2 Grid extensionreinforcement to connect remote WS to load centers 3 A fleet of quickreacting power plants to counteract the variable WS output on a lessthanminutebyminute basis 247365 to avoid destabilizing the grid. 4 A fleet of power plants to provide electricity during lowWS periods and during highWS periods when rotors are feathered and locked to provide the electricity not produced by WS systems to meet demand. 5 Output curtailments to prevent overloading the grid relative to demand i.e. paying owners for not producing what they could have produced From your link Currently the variable output of wind and solar is counteracted by fossilfired CO2emitting quickreacting power plants. Some people want to replace such power plants with largescale battery systems to reduce CO2 emissions. Sounds like they ignorantly think with the batteries the problem is solved. But since the battery power cant last long if its a major outage then what Just do without For days weeks or months If that wouldnt cause a revolution in the streets nothing would. A back of the envelope calculation shows that with a full windsolar grid the UK wouldve needed something like 650GWh of storage to make it through last Tuesday and probably 4TWh for last week. Cost of that above roughly 195 billion and 1.2 trillion. Clearly batteries cannot be the answer. Hydrogen would be much worse than batteries regardless of what the government idiots are saying again AtoZ basis Same basic problem they cant do maths Im not great at the subject but even with some simple additionsubtractionmultiplication I still appear to understand the problem better than they do.

See URL for Megapacks required for a oneday wind lull in New England 40 throughput is close to Teslas recommendation of 60 maximum throughput i.e. not charging above 80 full and not discharging below 20 full to achieve a 15y life with normal aging. Teslas recommendation was not heeded by the Owners of the Hornsdale Power Reserve in Australia. They excessively chargeddischarged the system. After a few years they added Megapacks to offset rapid aging of the original system and added more Megapacks to increase the rating of the expanded system. httpwww.windtaskforce.orgprofilesblogsthehornsdalepowerreservelargestbatterysysteminaustralia Regarding any project the bank and Owner have to be paid no matter what.

That gets worse with aging. A lot of people do not like these ckWh numbers because they have been repeatedly told by selfserving folks battery Nirvana is just around the corner. Wikipedia says 64 for Thermal Efficiency of CCGT In base loaded mode the 64 is possible but not likely In normal operating mode and WS counteracting mode the efficiency is less say about 50 still very good. Turbines lose efficiency if operated at part load efficiency vs load is curving downward wilpost Agree. As to LCOE even the EIA admits you cant really compare windsolar with dispatchable sources. Here is a quote from the EIAs 2022 Annual Energy Outlook httpswww.eia.govoutlooksaeoelectricitygeneration.php Because load must be continuously balanced generating units with the capability to vary output to follow demand dispatchable technologies generally have more value to a system than less flexible units that use intermittent resources to operate resourceconstrained technologies. We list the LCOE values for dispatchable and resourceconstrained technologies separately because they require a careful comparison. a careful comparison indeed. That would only happen with a honest Red TeamBlue Team review. The levelised costs are based on the cost over the 25year lifetime of the plant. Well thats all fine and dandy except Gas Generation Plants last far longer than 25 years so They need to add replacement costs for both Wind on and offshore and Solar That and they also need to calculate the of time that the gas plants are not running because renewables are. That of the capex needs to be paid no matter what usually in the form of higher prices from the gas operator. This is referred to as burdening the gas infrastructure without quite expaining what it means. But if you want to get a true comparison burden the renwables instead. Take that of capex for idle gas and subtract it from the gas model. Add it to the renewables. Now you have recovery of capex based on gas to back up renewables. Then run a few scenarios. Gas is running 75 of the time then 25 of the capex has to be burdened on renewables. If gas is running 25 of the time then 75 of the capex must be added to renewables. If gas is running 5 of the time then 95 of the capex must be added to renewables. Which is why jurisidictions with high renewables penetration have high electricity costs. The more renewables you have the higher the capex for the combined system must be Absolutely that extra cost fuel cost and idling costs should be calculated with the cost of renewables because if renewables werent an option the idling and associated portion of fuel costs wouldnt be a factor. In the UK grid we have the Capacity Market which pays out for having capacity available to be called on. Recent auctions for capacity 4 years ahead have cleared around 70kWa or 70mGWa which should cover financing depreciation and basic maintenance if a plant is allowed a full operation lifespan. Forecasts are that capacity market costs will exceed 4bn a year which is a cost that should be accounted against renewables I suspect it might run higher if plants are threatened with early closure in net zero by 2035 on the grid vanity. Did you mean 70MWh instead of 70kWh 70kWh would be grossly expensive. Using 1kWh per day 70kWh would cost 2100 monthly Neither. I meant what I wrote 70kWa or 70mGWa. A 1 GW plant would get 70m per year in payments for simply being available. It has nothing to do with how much it gets used or how much output it produces.. I see thanks for splainin it Fire up all fossil fuel and nuclear generators build new fossil fuel and nuclear generators. Remove all wind and solar from the grid remove all mandates for renewables. Keep the grid maintained and updated. One of the main reasons Europe is in such deep dodo is the elites mistakenly thought WS would be sufficient. They were advocating it for the whole world. They knew storage would be expensive and therefore kept minimizing needed storage capacity to get through WS lulls I pointed this out to numerous folks with weather data etc. and was laughed at etc. way back in 2000. Since 2020 the WS system costs per installed MW have increased by at least 50 to 75 plus grid extensionreinforcement plus output counteraction plus environmental damage plus hazardous landfill . WS have become totally unaffordable It takes a long while for that reality to sink into the ossified brains of the bureaucrats especially the ones in Brussels. The UK is on a much higher level of stupidity than Brussels but as usual they refuse to own up their stupidity a mixture of stiff upper lip and not seeing the forest for the trees for which no cure has been found yet. A great ally for the US to get rid of.. That would indicate a total cost excl Carbon Cost of about 56MWh. I dont get this. The headline says Updated CCGT Costs Confirmed As Much Cheaper Than Renewables But the figures for VRE are 44MWh 38MWh 41MWh. How is that cheaper Maybe relative to the CfD bid price for offshore wind Well for a start you should compare on the same basis. A strike price for a CfD incorporates separate risk calculations. And offshore wind is the most expensive of the renewables. You can always get the spreadsheets and do your own calculations Im not disputing Pauls calculation for now. But Paul has not produced a number that has gas cheaper than renewables. In fact not one that is cheaper than the earlier DESNZ analysis. Because currently operating CFDs pay over 150MWh and they will still be operating for some years yet and the CFDs yet to come into operation are over 80MWh for offshore wind which is the bulk of the output. In any event it is clear that DESNZ have failed to allow for curtailment. Just look at what happens to utility solar in Australia. The CfDs cannot be compared with LCOE. LCOE for example does not include profit. LCOE includes financing cost. That is often split between debt financing paying interest and equity finance paying dividends. See for example this from Lazard the high priests of LCOE fictions. Those renewables need to be replaced 24 times over the potential life time of a gas generation plant which can be 60 years with proper maintenance. You give no backing for that claim. But construction and OM are included and make up almost the total of the renewable costs. For CCGT cost of fuel is by far the largest part and on its own matches the total cost of renewbles. Sun and wind are free. LCOE calculations are works of fiction and really not useful especially as we move to higher levels of renewables penetration. They are also used to mask a host of assumptions that likely skew the results such as plant life mid life refurbishment costs optimistic load factors etc. It makes a deal more sense to consider capital cost annualised via a capital charge methodology and any fixed maintenance cost and then to consider output related costs for fuel and maintenance. However the reality is that dispatchable power will have a higher market value precisely because it can be produced with intermittent power is not sufficiently available. Renewables output will move from displacing dispatchable power for which it can claim equivalent value into increasing periods of being in worthless surplus cannibalising revenues. The surplus will largely end up being curtailed since it is far too costly to store more than a small amount as the consequence of trying to store more is that the storage turns over too infrequently to make a margin. The result is that the effective cost of renewables has to be measured against its actual useful output which will be much less. Add in all the additional costs for extra grid stabilisation and balancing and renewables are seen to be no bargain at all. Paul please define an acronym the first time it is used in a story. I had no idea that CCGT meant combinedcycle gas turbine power plant until I looked it up. And if that is wrong all the more reason to define your terms at the beginning of an article. And why not give us a little detail about what a CCGT power plant is Educate us a little so we can better understand your point.

Unfortunately it is a sign that too many scientists would rather offer elitist insults then address reasonable concerns and different ideas. Leslie Eastman I have been following Scientific Americans steady decline both in terms of its handling of science and its actual support of policies helpful to this nation. A few of my recent articles show that progressive ideology has pretty much captured this oncerespected publication. One of the primary reasons this descent into madness has accelerated is that the editorinchief Laura Helmuth has allowed pseudoscience and narratives to flow unfiltered with little if any restraint. Flush with power after the apparent success of endorsing Biden in 2020 Helmuth and the team at Scientific American endorsed Harris in this election cycle. Their faulty reasoning and inanityfilled platitudes were met with mocking. But I am sure Helmuth and her crew were sure they positioned Harris for success. However when the popular votes were counted and the electoral ones tallied President Donald J. Trump clearly prevailed. Arguably Americans were voting against the progressive agenda that the magazine was pushing. Once the magnitude of the Trump win became apparent Helmuth lost all sense of professional decorum and scientific objectivity and had herself a spectacular social media meltdown. Helmuth simply became another leftist woman completely losing it simply because the other candidate won the presidential election. In doing so she embarrassed herself and diminished Scientific American a little bit more. As a woman of science myself I went through the same experience myself. However instead of insulting those who failed to see how awful Biden and his administration would be I doubled down on the work I did to support the solid science we need to develop and implement better policies. Granted I carried on after some alcohol and many supportive calls from friends and family. To be fair Helmuth is now disavowing her statements. But there are signs that Helmuths protective bubble has burst. Ultimately however this is not just about an editor or a particular journal. It is a symptom how screed and rageposting has become normalized in areas of science that intersect with policy and politics. Scientists are human and are entitled to all their opinions and feelings. But those who wish to be taken seriously especially by the public must return to the roots of science and embrace the scientific method. They also must be willing to be challenged and debated by those who have different viewpoints. There are small signs that some antiTrumpers in the scientific community may be doing a wee amount of selfreflection. In an editorial in Science H. Holden Thorp professor of chemistry at George Washington University opens with a massive insult to both the President and his supporters..but finally concludes It is sometimes said when talking about the loss of trust in science that its less worrisome because the loss is tied to the overall loss of trust in institutions. That is true The overall trust in scientists is still strong compared with most other sectors and the decline is similar to that for the military and religious leaders. But why settle for that Public trust in science could far exceed that engendered by opaque and bureaucratic institutions if the scientific community stops acting like them. That means being more forthcoming and accessible showing that scientists indeed update ideas when new data come along and putting people and the public interest ahead of money and status for the powerful. Perhaps Thorp will rereview what he wrote and perhaps offer less insults and publish more articles challenging the powerful and the special interests foisting specific sciencebased narratives on this country. A great deal of trust in science has now evaporated and saying Trump and his supporters tap into xenophobia sexism racism transphobia nationalism and disregard for truth isnt going to restore that trust. Science publications institutions and researchers must return to their roots of questing for knowledge and innovating in ways that serve our country rather than dictate terms and conditionsand insulting nonscientists who have serious and thoughtful concerns about the information being dished out. CYA girl I remember that it was one of the first magazines I subscribed to when I graduated 40plus years ago. Still have the old copies in the basement. She is a disgrace. Ditto I always enjoyed getting SciAm in the mail and usually read it covertocover but somewhere around the turn of the century it started getting more obviously biased left in its articles to the point that I finally didnt renew my subscription. Disappointing but not surprising to see that it has continued its decline into irrelevance. Now its just another institution thats been ruined by leftist ideology. Same here. I subscribed to SciAm for many years. Whats funny is that I received a survey from SciAm and I said Keep doing what youre doing. Then they published a hit piece on Lomborg. Its not that I agree with Lomborg but the stupid hit piece was obviously biased. I canceled my subscription because of that hit piece. Yes the Lomborg rant was also the end for me. Thats the January 2002 issueaccording to Google. Gone are the days when SciAm was a respected magazine. I stopped subscribing in the 80s and it has only gotten worse since then. ditto Back then you wanted a tranny with a stick in your car. Was the stick to beat the tranny Now you have to beat the tranny with a stick to get them off your car at least when they are riotingprotesting. Ditto and Ditto to DonRT. I canceled my subscription sometime prior to 1980 dating by where I lived at the time when the political article which was usually the first one was all about how communist capitol cities are better than capitalist ones and used the two Koreas as its examples. Picture of Seoul was bright colorful packed sidewalks store windows full of light and products. Picture of Pyongyang was dull gray no people no traffic no signs no store windows nothing. I let it expire. Such a stupid thesis anyway and to illustrate with the worst pair possible was beyond my tolerance even if it did still have other good articles. Same here. I used to subscribe to Scientific American and Science News. I dropped them both when their quality went down and when they became political. My father subscribed to the magazine around 1960 when I was in middle school. I read it cover to cover. The magazine then featured articles by leading researchers about their research. Many of them won Nobel Prizes. It was an exciting era in science. Subatomic particles plate tectonics DNA computing lots of really substantive stuff. The magazine also had wonderful regular features. Martin Gardners Mathematical Games was stunning if a bit over my head. His books are still in print. The Amateur Scientist featured do it yourself scientific experiments such as how to build your own telescope including grinding the mirror and a cyclotron in case you wanted to make subatomic particles in your garage. I used an article on how to build a cloud chamber out of a coffee can for my 8th grade science project. I photographed what I took to be a cosmic ray with my grandfathers Polaroid camera. I might have become a scientist but for a catastrophic misadventure with 2nd year calculus in college. After that I declared a history major. The deterioration of the magazine has paralleled the deterioration of science. The physical sciences seem to have played out. Sabine Hossenfelder a German physicist has documented this on her website. The funding and the attention is now on the religion of climate science which is mostly video games having no contact with the real world. But much of science is plagued by fraud and malpractice. The most important scientific publication now is Retraction Watch. When my now 40 year old children where in middle school the science teacher taught them how to collect garbage. Aggravated the he11 out of me. I am sure it is much worse now. I might have become a scientist but for a catastrophic misadventure with 2nd year calculus in college. After that I declared a history major. That is not an uncommon experience. I think that the problem came from the emphasis on solving integrals which is facilitated by rote memorization of trigonometric equalities and learning little tricks such as sina a for very small angles. The irony is that with the ready availability of computers today numerical approximation has become more common than exact solutions. There are plenty of computer algebra programmes that will tackle soluble problems in calculus. Mathematica and Maple are probably the most comprehensive. putting people and the public interest ahead of money and status for the powerful. Hmmm I thought science the scientific method was all about putting data first. The whole point of the scientific method was to avoid the recognized tendencies of humanity to gravitate to their own biases. And the understanding that is the only way to get to the truth of the reality of the world we live in. If their scientific method were data first they would as very first thing ask themselves Why are my opinions exactly the same of the powerful like SorosGates etc and the DavosWEF people The data would tell them that they have all their opinionsespecially the new ones noone ever had on this planet until Obama appeared from billionaires who the MSM and Big Tech whose propaganda they parrot. And how comes that even uneducated people from 3rd world countries realised 3 years ago that Biden is demented which a top public interest as people wants to know who runs the country but the Scientific American experts did not until the billionaires owned MSM told them 3 month ago. Especially when we consider that Miss Helmuth at least she knows her gender has a Ph D in cognitive neuroscience. Scientific American jumped the shark into full political advocacy during SDI Star Wars about forty years ago. Yeah it was way back then that I cancelled my SCI AM subscription. The rot was evident long ago. In the previous year SCI AM had inspired me to write a FORTRAN program making graphic images of the Mandlebrot set. Maybe Im getting too old. I just shitcanned WSJ because I dont want pay to be part of a community where I cant use the text BS without being chastised for violating its standards. I have been reading Scientific American since I was introduced to it by my father as a teenager and I have been a subscriber for over 40 years. It certainly became very woke over the last several years but I detect that this has softened this position more recently. Nevertheless its position on climate change and gender issues is still more than problematic. It has been followed in this attitude by other magazines such as New Scientist. I carefully considered renewal of my subscription to each of these magazines but continued them rather reluctantly. My concern is that unlike WUWT it is not possible to make public comments on articles either in the magazine or in the daily newsletters that both these magazines support. I guess that in addition to following tradition they also take the attitude that because this is science the articles are beyond criticism by the plebs. You also find that letters to the editor not conforming to the woke and climate paradigm will not be published. It would be nice if they would allow public comment and then maybe they would learn that not everybody agrees with the them. In short I am unsurprised that their editor had a meltdown after the election. In short I am surprised you continue to pay for that privilege. In 1628 Harvey published de Motu Cordis his early attempt to describe the circulatory system. Many doctors at the time said that they would rather err with Galen than proclaim the truth with Harvey. Almost 400 years later it seems that scientists have not appreciably advanced in their ability to leave their beliefs and emotions behind and look at the world dispassionately Whether one likes Trump or his voters should have nothing to do with any scientific study or how one allocates govt resources after a natural disaster Sadly those that have allowed their minds to be filled with propaganda and lies often have trouble keeping their emotions in check Those that can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities Voltaires words seem to have been written for the current age Theres a book out The Revolt of the Public by Martin Gurri that talks about the end of the Age of Mass Media and the Age of Authority and experts. I admit that I stopped reading Scientific American decades ago because politics. Scientists have been good friends of the politicians and the politicians have reciprocated by filling their pockets with gold. She appears to be weak and unstable she needs to go. To be replace by a week unstable DEI hire. Thats like replacing Joe with Kamala. IMO she should stay and say thank you to her because she is the first to actually say what she really thinks. Usually these intellectually and morally so superior guys are really good in hiding their real character. If shes not a childless cat lady she sure looks like one. It was obvious drunk texting In 1989 Scientific American expressed serious interest in my proposal to take over The Amateur Scientist department. They flew me to New York to discuss details and the entire editorial staff was impressed by the various devices I showed them. But after the editor learned I reject Darwinian evolution he canceled my assignment to write the column only three of which they published. When a friend at a Houston newspaper wrote about this my loss of the famous column became an international news story. The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post called for interviews. The New York Times sent an editor to my rural office. Many newspapers supported me in their editorial. I did more than 100 radio interviews. Full details are in my new memoir Maverick Scientist. While the Texas ACLU offered to represent me in a suit against Scientific American I chose not to sue. Meanwhile my misadventure at Scientific American was punctuated by several false statements made by its editor all of which were contradicted by his own voice in a recording my attorney advised me to make. Harpers Magazine published the recording which greatly embarrassed the famous magazine. After the magazines editor was replaced Scientific American published one of my letters to the editor and a major news story about my findings in a NASAsponsored campaign in Brazil to measure the atmosphere during the annual burning season. In short the magazine tried to repair the damage they had inflicted on me. This new development however shows that the magazine has not learned a vital lesson in publishing particularly scientific publishing Never hire incompetent bigoted staff and never insult your readership. In view of my prior experience with Scientific American I feel amply qualified to request that the magazines management immediately replace the editor and any staff who have insulted me and any others of its readership with their profane opposition to the results of the recent election. I close by noting that I decided to do full time science for one year after the Scientific American debacle to prove that a person without a science degree can invent scientific instruments and use them to make discoveries published in leading scientific journals. As described in Maverick Scientist that one year was 35 years ago and my many research papers have been published in more than a dozen leading journals including the two most famous Nature and Science. Interesting comment. I have a couple of your books that I purchased from Radio Shack a while back. Thanks for all of your contributions. Why do reject Darwins theory evolution That was my first thought. Is there a better scientific explanation for the development of the many different forms of life In Darwins time genes had not been discovered. However the modern discovery of the DNA code tends to confirm Darwins hypothesis of evolution. We share a certain number of DNA genes with all forms of life including plants. The DNA code along with mountains of geologic evidence no pun intended. The fossil record is suggestive of evolution but by its very nature it is spotty at best. DNA has a more compelling staus. Functional conservation is quite compelling indeed. The gene that codes for the development of a flys wing will signal the development of a human arm if grafted in the proper place. There is no doubt of the relatedness of all life. Im not a geologist but I do try to follow what happens in paleontology I think by now its not all that spotty. The old creationist argument about gaps in the fossil record doesnt work any more. Every time a gap gets filled theyll say but theres still a gap between that new fossil and .. I am aware of the claims that gaps have been filled. In many such cases a single fossil serves to demonstrate the possibility of a transitional form but it still remains hopeful speculation. It is impossible to tell if a specimen represents an actual evolutionary step or is simply a mutant aberration or a limited variation within a group. The fossil record is rather like a library struck by an explosion and the few remaining damaged books and scattered pages that survive are used to tell a story. Geologic superposition does give a reasonable timeframe for gross comparison but the resolution is poor. Entire species have been insisted upon based on a single fragment of jawbone or an inconsistent tibia. The concept of species itself is little more than a convenience for classification and remains poorly defined. It is even more problematic when applied to fossils. Nonetheless as I said elsewhere I find the theory compelling and I lean toward acceptance but doubt cannot and should not be discounted or ridiculed. The fossil record is rather like a library struck by an explosion and the few remaining damaged books and scattered pages that survive are used to tell a story. Again Im not a geologist but I think the fossil record is much better than that. There are many regions where rock layers are stacked up representing tens of millions of years and loaded with fossils. Even if the fossils are found in different regions as long a the rocks can be dated and they can in most places then what follows what can be determined. From what I can tell the fossil record is very good and getting better every day. I believe there are several geologists active here perhaps they can explain this better than I can. As you point out the stratigraphy gives us a general indication of the passage of time and the fossils therein do indeed indicate a progression of successive life forms. However they remain snapshots rather than continuous records. Much is certainly missing since the conditions for fossilization are not constant and many layers are deposited and removed leaving no trace. Dating has limitations as well resulting in low resolution and comparisons for that purpose often rely on the fossils themselves. I quarried Eocene fossils in the Green River Formation for nine years and they have a couterpart assumed to be contemporary with them in Germany. It is quite fascianting and you are correct that they tell us much and suggest even more. That being said the questions remain as to how the changes occurred and much assumption is employed. As a biologist I am humbled by how improbale such complex mechanisms as life in all of its diversity truly are. When you consider the intricacy of a single cell with all of its carefully balanced components and chemistry and expand it to a myriad of even more complex forms it is daunting to contemplate. To think it all a random occurrance is almost frightening and I can understand why some people need to invoke a supernatural component. To think it all a random occurrance is almost frightening Thats the thing. The biochemistry isnt random nor are the environmental constraints. Every living thing is a transition to some other eventually. Just because the fossil record is spotty doesnt make it false. Considering the conditions required for fossilization its amazing we have as good a record as we do. I never said it was false. I indicated it was inconclusive regarding specific evidence for speciation in part for exactly the reason you offer. So little is preserved and even less of that is accessible to us. We can hardly hope for conclusive proof under such conditions. I find it interesting that the opposite condition of abundant but overlooked evidence can also exist. Communities of scientists sometimes appear to reinforce their own willful blindness to the obvious. The evidence of an Ice Age is all around us yet few took note of such a concept even into the era of the savants of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. From John McPhees Annals of the Former World In Europe Noahs Flood had for so long been regarded as the principal sculptor of the earth that almost no one was inclined to hazard an alternative interpretation. In 1815 an alpine goat hunter and mountaineer named Perraudin pointed out to a leading geologist of the time that all those big boulders standing around in odd places had been carried there by a glacier long since gone. But it was a decade later that the skeptical geologist Jean de Charpentier was persuaded in a moment of sudden insight that those erratic boulders out of place in their current location striations in the rock polished bedrock lateral and terminal moraines could only have been caused by mountains of moving ice on the land. His first paper on the revelation was ridiculed. Still years later Charles Darwin reading the Studies of Glaciers went out into the countryside to see for himself and immediately recognized the earmarks of an ice age. In a letter to a friend he reported with great excitement The valley about here and the inn at which I am now writing must have been covered in at least 800 or a thousant feet in thickness of solid ice. Similarly the movements of continents was denigrated despite the geological evidence of common rock types and fossils along what clearly were contiguous coasts. Not til 1960s when ocean spreading was recognized and reported did plate tectonics become a thing taught in schools. Says McPhee the plates may only move a few inches per year but over 250 million years thats fast enough for the continents to chase each other a third of the way around the globe smashing into each other and shaping our world as they go. For some ideas to prevail evidence needs to be piled on top of evidence till the facts become irresistible and their moving mass slowly scours away the doubts and fictions that have taken root. And before the arrow can hit the target it must cross half the remaining distance and before it can complete its journey it must pass half of the remaining distance Why do you limit your question to only scientific explanation I consider evolutionary theory to be a compelling one. However questions remain that are troubling. For instance the origin of life requires as much faith absent evidence as biblical Genesis and is nothing more than pure untestable speculation. Other big gaps are the irreducible complexity of cellular function and the Darwinian unfitness of transitional forms. For instance a foreleg slowly becoming a wing suggests a transitional form that could neither run nor fly and would be selected against rather quickly. Theoretical adaptations such as punctuated equilibrium and quantum evolution attempt to address this concern. Darwin demonstrated natural selection and variation within species but unfortunately macroevolution the transition of species may always be largely speculation. The origin problem is still the really big one. Even if the chemistry of life is extremely complex given the vast number of planets it seems reasonable that a few would succeed even if we as of yet dont know how. Stephen Jay Gould was mystified by how unicellular species could become multi cellular he wrote a book on this problem. It all seems to difficult yet the overwhelming evidence is that it happened. Decades ago I debated fundamentalist Christians who said evolution didnt happen because it couldnt happen. But it seems that it did happen ergo it could happen. The alternative of special creation by some Divinity has its own problems only much more so. Im waiting for some aliens to come down in their UAP whove been watching the Earth for millions of years to tell us how it happened. Regarding UAP be sure to watch the Congressional hearing on the 13th on this topic. The two concepts are not mutually exclusive. Evolution could indeed proceed as outlined in theory. There is no reason to insist that it could not have been orchestrated by a divine being. The one cannot be used to disprove the other. A divine being that would orchestrate billions of years of suffering and death is one I have no interest in but of course that doesnt prove it didnt happen that way. According to the late Michael Flynn the mediaeval approach was that work to advance the understanding of nature was Gods will as it provided insight into His thinking. That seems a nice way to reconcile religion and empirical research. Im glad you chimed in as SciAms treatment of you was disrespectful. The whole point of The Amateur Scientist was informing laymen on how to do some relatively simple and interesting science experiments and you have a good track record with experimental science. I second Scarecrow Repairs comment about the SciAm article praising North Koreas urban planning as a sign that the magazine was going to far left. OTOH back in the 1930s SciAm published an article praising the German eugenics program. My personal red flag for a scientific publication is when they use Mt Palomar for the location of the Palomar Observatory. SciAm was pretty good about getting that right prior to 1980 or so but by the mid 1990s it was a rare treat to see them use the correct Palomar Mountain. I saw he same thing happen to Science News about 20 years ago about the same time they started beating the Climate Change drums SN used to be an enjoyable read. Yeah kind of a mystery when this started. It is Palomar Observatory and Mount Wilson Observatory. Mt Wilson Observatory is on Mt Wilson Palomar Observatory is on Palomar Mountain. FWIW Sky Telescope still gets it right along with other place names such as Hawaii and does a reasonable job of covering competing hypotheses of explanations for observed data. That is they are focused on science as a process. How do they do with Viet Nam I used to argue against creationist about evolution. Then global warming advocates appeared and these socalled allies swallowed it hook line and sinker. I watched these allies use logic and science to argue with these antievolution types. But they didnt use similar techniques with the global warming types. So now I question scientific evolution. I still think evolution is correct but much of the science is flawed. For one thing Ive never understood their handwaving about how chromosome count can increase in a population. Nondisjunction doesnt seem to get there. Scientific American is no longer scientific. Its stupid. Kind of an oxymoron really. Especially when it is owned by a German corporation. Yeah but changing their name to Bolshevik Lysenkoist would be too obvious. Unscientific UnAmerican Sc Am .. President Trump had basically the same number of votes in each of the last 2 elections. It seems that 12 million people decided not to vote. Or maybe there was voter fraud in 2020. Still 8 mill plus votes to count. California has 22 mill electors and as it uses mail in voting extensively signature verification is a slow process. Also Oregon and Washington are still counting and they are democratic leaning too. You are making assumptions without all the data plus you have seen a graph with no zero axis which manipulates the differences between elections to make them bigger than they are It will end up with close to same total votes as 2020. Thus disproving your hypothesis How can we still not be done counting Mail ballots need signature verification and those that arent clear are checked back with the voter Good question. Lots of voters wont turn out to vote for an incredibly poor candidate no matter who the alternative is thats hardly surprising. Had the Dems been able to field even a remotely adequate candidate theyd have likely won comfortably. Thats for sure the most stupid thing I read in a while. The Dems had the best candidate ever in 2008. He had absolutely everything on his side. A MegaHype. All MSM Big Tech Hollywood and everyone else for him. A crippled shadow as opponent with McCain noone gave a crap about and a catastrophic 2nd Bush term as legacy. Yet Super Messiah Obama only got 69 mio votes. But here comes Biden who had absolutely nothing going on for him. Demented SlowScandals en massa crackaddict son with a sextape Biden refused to campaign and was hiding in the basement. He didnt had Hilarys female voter base. He got totally crushed by Sanders in the primaries until a miracle happened and he started winning for no reason. 1 The democrats had absolutely not a remotely adequate candidate in 2020. They sent a dead horse against Trumps booming economy and still won the race. 2 It is literally impossible to outperform Obamas votes yet every following democrat did it easily. 3Even if we ignore massive irregularities that never happened before in history Trump was leading until this point and then started to happen half a dozen time within an hour and the following impossibility that every single irregularity completelyturned the voting tide this never happens at the end stage it is an impossibility that the VAP vote goes up from 52 to 62 . The VAP turnout has always been 52 1 throughout the decades. Even Obama couldnt change it. But here comes Joe.UnpopularInvisible and gets 12 mio votes and a VAP ratio of 62 during the worst possible voting conditions lowest VAP ratio to be expected as result of Covid. Thats absolutely impossibilissimo Yet it happened. Because we know ALL irregularities be it data adjustments assassination attempts lawfareaccounting errors in favor of Ukraineextremely biased journalismwitchhunts etc happen in favor of globalists. They have the same luck as the Clintons have with people who become problematic. And the 2024 irregularity Underperforming Kamala only overperformed in no voterID states. it is an impossibility that the VAP vote goes up from 52 to 62 . The VAP turnout has always been 52 1 throughout the decades. The VAP turnout has always been 52 1 throughout the decades. Im on the other side of The Pond so may be missing something obvious to USAians but isnt VEP Voting Eligible Population rather than VAP Voting Age Population a more appropriate denominator here So why do you think 10 million voters who were happy to back Biden 4 years ago stayed at home this time around 8 mill votes yet to be counted. nationwide. 1 of the national vote is still 1.5 mill votes most states have at least 13 OUTSTANDING California has only 66 of its presidential votes counted according to AP many are still arriving as they only need to be post marked election day. The state sends mail ballots to every voter you dont have to ask Harris is already at 71 mill votes and Trump at 74.7 mill which shows how outdated that faked no axis comparison was just a few days ago President Trump had basically the same number of votes in each of the last 2 elections. It seems that 12 million people decided not to vote. Attached is one version of that graph. Notes If you zoom in on this image file you can see the exact numbers for further analysis All numbers are preliminary Watch out for the nonzero minimum Yaxis value From 2016 to 2020 both the Democrat and Republican vote counts went up sharply . Or maybe there was voter fraud in 2020. There almost certainly was some voter fraud in 2020 as there is in all elections the problem is in trying to quantify just how much voter fraud actually occurred and therefore whether it might have affected the final result or not. There are many social media articles about how individuals came across discrepancies with their personal friends andor family but any questioning that ended up in court usually concluded with a ruling of You do not have standing. Case dismissed. No further investigation will be performed. One example of another approach is Jeff Id on his the Air Vent blog who has written several posts about extreme statistical outliers from 2020. I have no idea how many of those stories are true or how much has been distorted in the telling. What is needed is a full audit of at least one county or even a state that has raised question marks over the last 4 years but I doubt that the physical evidence not just ballots but ballot envelopes has been reliably stored since 2020. There was an audit in the largest AZ county for 2020 but somehow the results were kept hidden. Lie. Maricopa was partisan audited by a election denial group who supressed for a while and when released the result the same as before with tiny change httpswww.reuters.comworldusarizonarepublicansreleasefindingswidelypannedelectionaudit20210924 There were 2.1 mill ballots Truth is truth numbers are numbers Fann said at a Senate hearing on the review which found only small variations yielding 99 additional votes for Biden and 261 fewer votes for Trump. Those numbers were close within a few hundred. plonk Your numbers are way out of date and the graph refuted just days later Trump is now 74.7 mill and climbing. Harris is now 71 mill and climbing that puts her at Trumps numbers on the graph Millions more votes to come but obviously Trump won. Just 1 un counted vote is 1.5 mill people I personally know a few people who withheld their vote from both candidates as a form of protest. I used to subscribe to and loved Scientific American many years ago but when it put politics above science I cancelled my subscription. The debasement of science that they have pursued since is a tragedy. There is something about older women with long unkempt grey hair that puts me off. There is a saying about not judging a book by its cover. There wouldnt need to be a saying like this unless we as a judgemental species did this all the time. There is an expectation of being professional in your appearance. There is also an expectation that you would be aware of your appearance. Younger women teenage are cute with long hair. She is not. My MY experience with older longhaired grey folk male or female is that they are a little looney. end of rant. Yeah I saw a video clip of an old silver haired woman ranting about how Trump was going to take away OUR rights to have an abortion. It occurred to me that menopause would have put paid to any concerns she might have about the need for an abortion. Reality has left the room folks. Yer. I had some friends that I deeply respected and had good times with skiing bush walking cycling and and the like who moved to the isolated community of Canberra. Then in no time at all one became a green dictatorial grey stringhaired but no cats. Any conversation around any topic invariably became slush. Earlier in the Year I called in to meetup and see how my former colleague was fairing with dementia. My bum had not even met the seat when she wanted to know in aggressive tones if I was voting Yes for the voice. I said I did not believe Australia should be divided by race. Same thing same insane inflexible attitude same rants same discordance Sad but true. I hope he is OK. b. Wow. All the things she gets wrong and you fixate on whether or not you would want to f her. Wow. He mentioned us being a judgemental species and here you are. He didnt say anything remotely indicating that he wanted to engage with a bit of horizontal hiphop with her just that she presents as a frump. metoo I think you need to seek help. Cute is children small animals outfits behaviour. Sexy is different. I could describe someone as sexy but it doesnt mean I want to dryhump their leg. Its simply a description. If I describe someone as ugly it doesnt mean I wish to do physical harm to them. You may not be able to tell a book by its cover but I have found that one can learn a lot from the colorful illustrated dust jacket. I guess a book titled Black Holes with a nude on the cover is quite possibly not a physics book. IIRC she has journalism and social sciences degrees. Why is she editing an alleged science journal Because its content not truth or science. We all constrain our behavior in dealing with each other. Its called politeness. It allows civil society to function. Why do leftists think it right to abandon the norms of civility Dunno but maybe you could ask them very gingerly Trump Derangement Syndrome Harvard cancels classes after US election result Trump would earn a motzah in the sewer drain cleaning business. I would have thought using the eff word is so unladylike and demeaning it becomes sackable Are you sure she identifies as a lady Its more that the mask slipped regarding her attitudes to 50 of Americans. It immediately calls into question whether articles are accepted on merit or for their political ramifications. I expect editors to have bias they shouldnt have but they are supposed to keep it quiet so that there is a veneer of respectability about their rag. Once great Sci Am now has no credibility. Do you think she should wear highheels in the office and smile more too Dropping Fbombs isnt clever or businesslike though I do believe there is a time and place to break through mimsy. But disapproving of it becaus its unladylike I handed in my SciAm subscription about 1992 and gave my accumulated copies to our corporate library. It had lost its scientific integrity. There was a time when scientific reserch was mainly financed by corporations. Recall IBM 3M many medicals and pharmas many miners and so on. Then governments increased their intrusions and their offerings of grant monies so by 2000 it was mainly governments funding research. This is a simplified account. It varies by sector. Governments can make laws that attach to financing much more than industry could or would. But governments are political animals with some properties that do not mix well with top science research. So scientists took some valuable research time to write prescribed grant applications to political bodies. Service industries tied to scientific research like publications also became servants to pleasing governments. It has become somewhat of a mess. It was better without government help. I know I was there for both flavours over time.Pleasing the political class led to more expression of belief in scientific studies eating into the former evidence based approach. This is because most pollies can understand beliefs but few understand data. If the joint is to be cleaned up we have to get politics out of scientific research and funding and get industry back to strength. It is as simple as that. Geoff S. President Eisenhower predicted it. No publication that calls itself a science journal has any business getting involved in politics and issuing political endorsements. If one does so it instantly discredits itself as a science journal and its pronouncements thereafter are nothing but polemic. What Scientific American has become is just another degenerate rag. I would believe the same if SA came out in favor of Trump and GOP policies The old saying is that politics and religion dont mix like oil and water. Ditto for politics and science. The reason is simple politics and religion are all based upon knowing the truth and living accordingly. Science is based upon the search for truth and can never rest on knowing the ultimate truth about anything. Like oil and water. Perhaps the scientific method applied to issues up for debate in political arenas could help unravel the messy tangle we find occurring in many places. Wouldnt it be refreshing to hear that legislators were undertaking actual methodologically rigorous studies of climate gender issues for example Yes I know I dream. That last quote is not as reassuring as you might think. In fact it is not reassuring at all. One of the mantras of the Left is that If we only communicated better the ignorant masses would all fall in line after seeing how right we are This is the language of the school indoctrinators the reeducation camp administrators the elite wouldbe tyrants all over the world.

The Toyota COO said that electric vehicle policies are de facto mandates that are not in sync with consumer demand according to Bloomberg. Hollis also said that EV mandates such as those in California are impossible to meet according to CNBC. The whole EV ecosystem is ahead of the consumer Hollis told reporters Friday Its not in alignment with consumers. Its just not. The BidenHarris administration has introduced various EVrelated policies as part of President Joe Bidens climate agenda including introducing a tailpipe emissions rule in March that would require about 67 of all lightduty vehicles sold after 2032 to be EVs or hybrids. Biden has been leading a push to build half a million public EV chargers nationwide by 2030 that has so far been met with various slowdowns. RELATED Ford CEO Admits Driving Chinese EV After Receiving Billions From Taxpayers To Make Rival Cars Domestically Various American automakers have backpedaled on EV goals despite the current administration funneling billions of dollars in subsidies as part of its EV agenda. The California Air Resources Boards Advanced Clean Cars II regulations require that 35 of 2026 modelyear vehicles be zeroemission. I have not seen a forecast by anyone government or private anywhere that has told us that that number is achievable. At this point it looks impossible Hollis said of the zeroemission regulations. Demand isnt there. Its going to limit a customers choice of the vehicles they want. Many automakers have experienced issues with EV sales including used EV models experiencing drastic price cuts due to slackening consumer demand. Ford Motor Company announced in October that it lost an additional 1.2 billion on EVs in the third quarter and announced in September that it would offer free EV chargers and home installations to incentivize customers.

Who knew Its the leftist way to approach all their moronic ideas everything has to be achieved by EDICT instead of presentation of benefits making a rational case addressing causes of hesitance persuasion. electric vehicle policies are de facto mandates that are not in sync with consumer demand Literally by definition. Hey Anybody notice that Biden Harris lost the election chuckle so does this matter at all Id bet a dollar he wouldnt have said this if Harris had won. I think youll find that Toyota head honcho Toyodasan indicated not long ago that Toyota will continue to build only vehicles that consumers demonstrate that they want not what edits are imposed upon them. I think Newsom is now the real problem. California has a major problem with keeping the lights on. This makes it even worse for EV charging. Newsom is adding regulations to California fuel production and it is driving these companies to leave so gas and diesel will cost even more by December. The people are not going to buy EVs when they cannot pay for the vehicles and there are issues with electricity. The new Trump administration is almost guaranteed to end these mandates and the associated subsidies in short order. How much sense does it make to produce a product for which theres limited demand Watching for a Trump winddown on all this. Noting increased sales of second hand EVs because they are so cheap. There must be some sort of a battery life calculation where you sell on worth zero Trump will neither mandate or block the sale of EVs. He will however do everything he can to stop Chinese group EVs entering the USA. He will find a way to remove the ridiculous EPA emissions requirements and let the market decide.. And they will mostly NOT chose EVs. The inevitable result of command economics. Chaos and pain for the populace. Be careful. Next thing youll say is that tariffs are taxes and get a lot of kneejerk downvotes from all the hurt feelings. A tariff is a tax ONLY if someone wants to purchase that particular item from overseas. Income tax is a tax ONLY if someone has income. Now tell that to the IRS. Tell me Mr Smart Guy what is the point of a tariff on a product which is never imported The whole point of protective tariffs is to raise prices so much that inefficient uncompetitive domestic industry can sell expensive goods. Bunch of geniuses here. Cowards the lot knee jerk downvotes with no comments. Its a badge of honor to be downvoted by such cowards. The whole point of protective tariffs is to raise prices so much that inefficient uncompetitive domestic industry can sell expensive goods. You obviously are clueless about Trump ideas on tariffs They are first and foremost equalisation tariff. China puts huge tariffs or outright refuses US car imports to China. China also uses near slave labour on many item. To accuse US industry of being ineffective and uncompetitive.. pretty nasty thing to say to US manufacturing.. Are you a depressed and grieving Kamal supporter Very few people seem to understand the strategic significance of tariffs both economically and militarily. I am so sick of hearing about free trade which is a unicorn. President Trump has stated he will impose tariffs equal to other nations tariffs on U.S. goods. Were tariffs introduced and income tax eliminated people have the choice as to whether they buy goods and services from overseas and therefor whether they pay tax tariffs. People have more disposable income and have the choice to buy home made tariff free products or imported products with tariffs added whilst the nation uses the income from tariffs for public spending. If other nations manufacture goodsservices people demand national revenue from tariffs will be higher which encourages domestic manufacturers to compete on quality and service especially to export. Tariffs can be better adjusted to reflect the need for particular productsservices whereas incomelocal purchase taxes are a blunderbuss approach to raising national income which penalises people for working. Now thats all assuming a perfect world operating in harmony and that just doesnt happen however its a better starting point that swiping more and more income tax from people the harder they work. Income tax is theft with menaces. VAT Value Added Tax was introduced in the UK at 8 in the 1970s to give people the choice of buying things or not buying things. Pay the tax or dont. Our overall personal tax burden was guessing here somewhere in the 30 40 region. VAT is now 20 and our overall tax burden is 50. The current labour party are to impose VAT on what was hitherto considered an essential and therefore VAT free product private education of children under 18 years old. In reality its a continuing socialist war against even the modestly wealthy to punish them for having the audacity to have worked and saved hard to provide a quality education for their children. Tariffs eliminate that type of vindictive and targeted attack on individual groups of people. Well targeted tariffs are a good thing. There is value beyond end product price. For example what is it worth to have a domestic steel industry What is it worth to have a viable nanotechchip production capability Some manufacturing industries are simply too valuable to ship overseas. Its almost as if Leftists Socialists Marxists and Communists planned it that way. Exactly EV mandates are dumb I went to a Ford dealer late September to look at a Super Duty pickup. The sales guy tried hard to get me to consider an F150 Lightning of which they had several on the lot. I asked to order a custom build F250 because that was the only way to get what I wanted. While the computer guy was putting in my order the manager said they werent allowed to get more Super Dutys until the EVs sell and they are not selling. Nice way to grow your business. Ford is disaster. Is it Ford in this case If the government mandates that they MUST sell a certain percentage of EVs and fines per nonEV follow if they dont they literally cannot sell the nonEVs until the EVs have sold. The UK is worse Our government has set minimum EV targets 20 of sales this year from memory. For every ICE sold over that target the manufacturer is either charged 15000 or has to buy carbon credits from an EV manufacturer either Elon or China because there are no manufacturers here making enough EVs to have spare carbon credits to trade. By 2030 that EV target will be 80 100. I cant quite remember which because I cant be bothered finding out as its pie in the effing sky. Western government bureaucracies are now so infested with petty departments determined to be indispensable by raising money from the consumer its now a race to the bottom as governments take over our whole lives and we saw that ending very badly in the USSR but seem determined to reproduce it. The Future Abundant and cheap energy from Nuclear Power Natural Gas and Rooftop solar panels. All heating and cooling of houses from electric airconditioners. All cooking from electric stoves. Most vehicles to be batteryoperated for most situations where its practical. New battery technology which is safer and cheaper than LithiumIon and which doesnt rely upon significant amounts of scarce rareearth materials. What could better DELUSIONAL Why is it delusional Electricity is a marvelous invention. I have a split system airconditioner with a remote temperature control device which can change the temperature setting to whatever feels comfortable. I have an electrice stove and electric Microwave oven which are easy to use and very safe. I have a small area of solar panels on my roof covering about 110th of the total roof area which has significantly reduced my power bills during the past 15 years. Am I delusional to think that covering the entire roof with solar panels and using safe battery storage is a practical and an efficient source of energy for all my electrical devices and future BEV Whatever floats your boat Vincent. Your spend them on whatever legal pursuits you want. But why do you want everybody else to abide your preferences Thats the main issue. Items 35 are delusional Many people prefer gas top stoves EVs are only practical if your life exists around short distance shopping and commute and you never want to actually GO anywhere. New Battery tech.. whatever you want to believe. Safe battery storage on all houses would require an incredible amount of mining using fossil fuels. Yes.. it is a delusion. Yes. Us all choosing what we want to spend our own money on and our personal preferences would be far far better. In my opinion. Oh I see Like spending a 100000 on a huge sports car with a roaring engine and 200 on a pair of jeans that one can buy in Kmart for 20 and guzzling large quantities of expensive and tasty food which results in obesity and huge future medical expenses. The main problem in developed countries is not CO2 emissions but a huge waste of resources because people are sucked in by advertisements to buy unnecessary products to boost their ego and vanity. Oh look another totalitarian that wants to tell everyone what they have to do. Wants everyone to cowtow to his limited selfperception. We live in a society where everyone is told what to do at least part of the time. If you have an 8am to 4pm job in an office or factory and you turn up for work whenever you want and leave whenever you want youll likely be sacked. You are told to arrive at 8am and depart at 4pm. You dont have the choice to drive at whatever speed you like if that speed is above a speed limit. You are told by the signage on the road the speed you must not exceed. Regulations are everywhere to ensure human safety and efficient production. You think thats totalitarianism Wow how to say youre delusional without using the word delusional. For starters regulations mostly prevent efficient production not promote it. Cost reduction is what drives efficient production not government interference. As for speeding people do have a choice and some will choose to break the speed limit when it suits them. They also choose to pay any penalty which applies for that choice and if they dont pay they will have chosen to go to jail for that privilege. Your posts so far seem very idealistic unburdened by any of the harsh realities of life. Leftism always fails because lefties choose to ignore human nature and human nature always wins. For starters regulations mostly prevent efficient production not promote it. Cost reduction is what drives efficient production not government interference. Ill give you just a couple of examples how costcutting measures and a lack of sensible regulations resulted in very inefficient production taking everything into consideration. The Chernobyl accident in 1986 was the result of a flawed reactor design that was operated with inadequately trained personnel presumably to cut costs. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was a result of cutting costs by locating the reactor at a low level near the coastline which had previously been inundated by tsunamis. If the only penalty for violating a law is a fine then it is legal for a price. Too many laws on the books where there is no harmed party but the government extracts for not kowtowing to their fiats. It sounds like you wont ne happy until everything that is not forbidden is mandatory. WOW you really are a leftist child arent you. And NO when you take up a job you agree to work specific hours. You do not have to take that job if you dont want to work those hours. YOU are the one saying everyone and everything has to go electric. That is the farleft totalitarian idiocy that is currently destroying the UK. YOU are the one saying people shouldnt buy things that YOU deem unnecessary. Basically naffoff and stop trying to put your totalitarian idiotology onto other people. How is it your business what other people want to do with their money Vincent Isnt it obvious All the problems we face worldwide are due to spending money stupidly wastefully and unwisely. A very prevalent example is wasting a million dollars building a house on a flood plain or a river bank when the historical evidence available in the meteorological records shows that such areas are flooded on a fairly regular basis such as a major flood every 20 or 30 years on average. Now you may argue that anyone including multimillionaires and billionaires have the right to spend their own money on whatever pleases them. If the home of a wealthy person is demolished by a flood so what Their insurance takes care of it and they rebuild the house if they want to because they like the view and the location. Thats their right isnt it My point of view is that wasting money building structures that are at risk of being destroyed by extreme weather events is plain stupid. It should not be allowed. A sensible government should not allow such constructions to take place in such areas or at least they should ensure that such constructions will be resistant to the effects of previously known extreme weather events by changing the building codes. This is just one example. There are millions of examples throughout the world resulting in trillions of dollars being thrown down the drain. What a tragic waste at risk of being destroyed by extreme weather events Right so no one should be allowed to build anywhere there is a risk of flooding storm surges hurricanes tornadoes avalanches blizzards forest fires um have I missed any Because that really does limit where people can live. Perhaps you should stop drinking the koolaid then maybe that nasty case of lefty mindrot you have might clear up. How is your reading comprehension This is what I wrote. A sensible government should not allow such constructions to take place in such areas or at least they should ensure that such constructions will be resistant to the effects of previously known extreme weather events by changing the building codes. If youre an AGW skeptic you should be aware that blaming the destruction caused by extreme weather events on humancaused climate change lets the authorities off the hook. You should know that the continual increase in the destruction of property by extreme weather events is not a result of an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events but a result of incompetent officials allowing the construction of dwellings and infrastructure which are inadequate to withstand such extreme weather events that have occurred in the past in such areas and are with high confidence expected to reoccur in the future. WOW.. and you say you are not a totalitarian. It should not be allowed. Yet everything in your comment is totalitarian dictator style. Were not worthy. One mans stupidity is others wages. If the stupide person by your definition wishes to spend their money stupidly My point of view is that wasting money building structures that are at risk of being destroyed by extreme weather events is plain stupid. It should not be allowed. A sensible government should not allow such constructions to take place in such areas or at least they should ensure that such constructions will be resistant to the effects of previously known extreme weather events by changing the building codes. Like planning regulations for housing on flood plains and building codes for fire and cyclone areas There are alternatives to banning it. Ask the Dutch or most inland NSW towns. Are you saying these dont exist The Future may arrive someday. Perhaps in 97 years or more likely around 2197. AKA FUTURAMA Reply to Vincent And all planes will be grounded replaced by flying pigs they are now selling faster than EVs . w1454 That third picture reminds me of the world of The Giver. The Future if you had put a sarc tag at the end I would agree with you. If you really believe what you wrote then you deserve all the negative votes and more. What is the new battery technology Its a lot like fusion. Its always getting better but wont be ready realworld use for another 40 years. In forty years it will be almost ready in another 40 years. Rinse Repeat. Define where its practical please. In precise terms thanks. For example 45 of UK households have no off street parking. If you advocate for localised electricity production would you take that to its natural conclusion and advocate for localised water production i.e. each of us digging our own well on our properties And can you explain please how that would work with high rise buildings. In the UK for example much like the limited sunshine we get rain is a widespread phenomenon we could all collect but we dont. You might consider the Ricardo and Smith theories of specialisation before replying. Have you ever considered where all this electricityor the infrastructure to support it is going to come from If everyone in your neighborhood is charging 1 or 2 EVs I suspect your local electrical supply or equipment is totally inadequate. How about an apartment complex with 1000 units Could the infrastructure support 1000 x 50 amp slow chargers I do not believe we are building electrical infrastructure today which could support a 50 EV fleet even in 20 years. On the other hand gasoline and other oil related products could become very cheap Have you ever considered where all this electricityor the infrastructure to support it is going to come from If everyone in your neighborhood is charging 1 or 2 EVs I suspect your local electrical supply or equipment is totally inadequate. Didnt you read my original post. Heres what I wrote Abundant and cheap energy from Nuclear Power Natural Gas and Rooftop solar panels. If the supply or equipment in certain areas is inadequate then get it fixed by voting for politicians who understand the problem and promise to fix it. This is what democracy is about. I shall try once to educate you though you have shut off your critical thinking. There currently is not enough power on the grid to support an EV mandate so we would need to build a lot more capacity first capacity that the same people who want to mandate EVs want to prevent being built. Unless its wind or solar which will not power modern society. These people hate nuclear gas and coal so use lawfare to delay or stop projects. Our power transmission lines from power plant down to your house panel cant currently support the needed requirements to charge all those EVs so they will need to be beefed up first. Theres been studies done on how much metals it would take to increase the infrastructure and build all those EVs. We currently dont have enough developed mines to meet the demand by a far margin. Theres a bunch more reasons why EVs are not ready for prime time but lets cut it down the the last problem. High density living means a huge part of the population does not have a fixed place to park. Without a fixed place to park they cant just plug their car in after driving home so the car will be ready to go next morning. Sure some apartment complexes have assigned parking but my experience shows theres more vehicles than assigned parking. Next issue since you dont own your parking spot who pays install and maintain the charger. Also who pays for maintenance of those chargers Who is going to pay for all the missing charging cords that disappear over night so a meth head can sell the copper for their next fix How does making it illegal to steal since you are so in favor of laws fixing all problems stop the meth heads New battery technology which is safer and cheaper So they finally found the unicorn herd The Magic Battery is just around the corner and always will be. CARB and Congressional Democrats believe if you wish hard enough all cars will be BEVs. How hard Hard enough for it to happen silly Trump is going to be very busy the last 10 days of January 2025. So many FJB EOs to overrule. Then get things fixed via legislation via Congress we should not be ruled by decrees from a 21st century. Caesar. Free in home chargers A simple 18 120v or 240V Cable can cost 89 to 200 and higher and would require room in your breaker box for a dedicated 60A circuit breaker and take more than 12 hours to recharge. The larger Tesla type charger can draw 90 amps and would require a separate 100200A breaker box and meter panel. And higher amperage chargers need to run on 480v which most homes arent designed for. The 480V charger can recharge most EVs in under 4 hours but have a larger demand for electricity. One way around this might be a Parallel 240V double service but your utility co would need to hang a dedicated Transformer and the EV customer would bare the costs. Might even require replacing the Transformer pole with a new pole at an upgraded class to. Though for most residential services 240480 is too high as homes are designed as 120240. So likely your Free Home Charger will be a simple cable with a 120V plug. Correct majority of services into houses are twophase 240V AC changing over to 480 would be horrendously expensive or impossible. Nobody needs 480 vac or a level 3 charger at home they are only for use as public commercial installations. What kind of idiot downvotes proven facts. There is no debating this. There is no debating this. I think youre being downvoted for the absolute certainty with which you make the claim. Unless you know the needs of every household in the country you cant say that for certain. A level 2 EV charger only needs 240 vac all residential homes have 240 vac and no you dont need a new distribution panel since all of them already have 240 vac necessary for ranges water heaters dryers and AC units. All that is needed is to install an outlet A level 2 charger will easily charge an EV battery in a few hours. A level 3 charger can charge an EV in about an hour or less. Few EV owners will need to charge that fast almost none are ever installed at homes rather they are used as commercial public chargers. From Australian NRMA Level 2 singlephase Considered a middle ground in terms of charging your EV at home Level 2 singlephase provides a considerably increased power output and reduced charge times compared to using a wall socket Level 1 usually max 15A while not requiring major modification to a homes wiring to suit. While Level 2 singlephase charging receives the same singlephase 240v AC electrical feed as Level 1 its dedicated wall boxwall charger system can operate at much higher amperages of about 32A. ie about 7kW end A quick look seems to indicate that the cost of the box is around 1500 installation. Again a dedicated box is not needed to supply a level 2 charger at 240 vac. All home distribution panels supply 240 vac the number of amps supplied is determined by the rating of the breaker andor number of breakers and how the breakers are wired inside the panel. A higher current draw at a given voltage may use either a single higher capacity breaker or it may gang 2 or more breakers together to supply a particular outlet. Typical electric services in newer single family homes have 200 amp service while old homes may have less. Plenty to power a level 2 charger draw of 2080 amps. A 100 amp breaker in the distribution panel is sufficient. All that is needed to supply a level 2 charger is a 240 vac feed to an outlet. Ill take NRMA advice over a known lowQ ranter any day. Dont need a new box just another breaker at 100 amps and an outlet. Couple hundred dollars Dont ignore that the fuel cost for an EV is only 13 of gasoline or diesel. So a typical 200A panel 30A for oven. 30A for stovetop. 30 A for electric drier 60 A for heat pumpair conditioner 50100A for various 1520A small power and lighting circuits Yeah plenty of room for new 100A service. Just so long as you dont want to run anything else. Those appliances never all operate at the same time. so there is plenty of spare amps to run a 50 amp 240 volt charge overnight while folks are sleeping. so maybe just the heatpump is running and a few night lights. Fuel cost on Northern California has electricity at 0.40 per kWhr and gas is 3.70 so my 30 mpg Chevy is lower cost to operate than a Tesla. You forgot to mention that you need to add a 30 or 40 Amp double pole 240V breaker to the panel to power the outlet. Most newer residential installations are 200 Amp but there are a lot of 150 and 100 Amp panels out there. If an upgrade is necessary that can be a fairly large cost. I didnt forget anything. I wrote that a typical single family home distribution panel easily accommodates a 240 vac level 2 charger all that is needed is a breaker a 10 minute installation. Virtually all SF homes built within the last 50 or more years come with 200 amp service. If you have an old home with 60 amp service you have a problem anyway if like most homeowners you have AC electric water heater electric range electric dryer etc. Not to mention electric resistance space heating. In which case you need to install a modern 200 amp service and modern wiring. Anyone buying an old home has to either confirm that its distribution panel and wiring are up to modern standards or else they need to budget for a rewire. Electrical demand is only going to increase in the future. Maybe all very well for singlefamily homes Duane but in Canada for example 40 of their population lives in condo apartment multiunit type buildings. Capacity factors at local substations is the first order of concern for extra power draw before it even gets down to whats needed in residential building complexes to accommodate heat pumps allelectric appliances EV chargers etc etc. Nothing in public policy setting seems to get thought through completely these days does it What level charger is available for those who live in condos apartments or other multifamily housing Level 0 Condos and other MF housing have no problem installing level 2 chargers at assigned parking spaces. Indeed many are doing just that if a demand is perceived by their owners or renters. Here in south Florida most new condos are installing chargers at at least some of their parking spaces. It really makes little difference if it is level 1 or level 2 it is just whether 120 vac or 240 vac is available at a given parking spot. One can also choose to use public level 3 chargers if home charging is not practical. Lots of choices for EV owners they can choose where and how to charge. And as long as buyers are not forced to buy EVs over ICVs they can make their own decisions. Condos and other MF housing have no problem installing level 2 chargers at assigned parking spaces. BOOM A level 2 240VAC can pull upwards of 60A90A and many homes are wired with a 125A panel. And would either need a 200A replacement or a separate 100A panel with an individual meter. Not everyone has either the space in their Breaker Buss Bars to add 60A breakers without uprising either their panel andor their service. Also putting 2 EVs in every garage would require 2 chargers and a minimum 100A panel just for the chargers and potential up line upgrades larger services second services larger Transformers and up sized poles Virtually all new SF homes built in the last 50 years have 200 amp service. It is not necessary to install 2 chargers if one family owns 2 EVs. In almost all circumstances an EV does not need a full charge for typical commuting more than 12 times per week. A vehicle buyer has tons of choices whether to buy EV vs ICV how many of each to own where and how to charge. Every vehicle owner is free to choose what works best for them. If you dont want an EV dont buy one. What kind of idiot downvotes proven facts There is no debating this. You are entitled to your own opinion you are not entitled to your own facts. Duane when you grow up you wont care so much that the whole world agree with you. no you dont need a new distribution panel since all of them already have 240 vac You are aware that panels have max amp ratings too right Its not just the voltage that you have to consider. According my brother in law his Tesla charges at a whopping 4 mileshr off a 120V plug. It only works for them because he lives 1 mile from work has a disability that prevents him from easily walking that far and my sister no longer drives she has a disability that does not pair well with safely driving anywhere. I personally dont see how anyone with a normal driving habit can own an EV without also installing a charging station. Sure theres some public charging stations that may or may not work or have a long waiting line for in high population areas but in the burbs or out in the country good luck. I live in a small town and theres exactly 1 Tesla charging station nothing for any other EV. Wait 212 months and the current inhabitant of the White house will be gone and a new sane one will be there. Then all the idiotic EV mandates will disappear. Every watt of clean power can be consumed on other things besides charging up EVs. This can only mean one thing All the dirty power generated will go to the EV chargers. What good is it to move the pollution from the tailpipe to the smokestack What good is it to move the pollution from the tailpipe to the smokestack Moving the emissions out of congested areas. Certainly useful in places like China. But in most western countries most real pollution in congested areas is not necessarily from modern cars. Nuclear and hydro are clean. And natural gas is clean too. The issue is not CO2 the issue is all the other pollutants. In my neck of the woods we are not allowed to build nuclear by state law. Our wise lawmakers also downgraded hydro from cleangreen to dirty power with plenty of agitation to remove all dams to save the salmon. Yes a couple smaller dams have already been removed so they can study the impact to the rivers ecosystem. This is of course being done in preparation to remove larger dams. Dont let facts get in the way of the narrative. CARB and the Gov tried for just a 10 of all new auto sales shall be zero emissions in 1995 with the deadline of Y2K. Toyota and GM were on board and by Y2K it was a total failure with not even 1 zeroemission vehicles being sold. Even the GM EV1 got recalled and nearly every one got recycled into ICE cars. The deffinition of insanity is to keep trying the same thing and expect different results and at CARB and many other California alphabet agencies are totally nuts and divorced from reality. Cone on man. The laws of physics are null and void in California. Woke Fisics France wants handouts from the EU to save local EV makers from Chinese coal fired ones France to EU Rescue Our Cars or Risk Losing to Chinas EV Powerhouse Theyve forgotten former GM president Roger Smiths quote that nobody will lie to you like a battery engineer Right now there is a minimum wait time of 2 years for substation transformers. I quote an owner of a power engineering consulting firm We are becoming a 3rd world country. He also told me that once a solar farm solar generating station reached it endoflife 2025 years it becomes the responsibility of the land owner. For reference land use requirements for 2axis PV farm ranges from 3 13 acresMWAC. A MWAC is defined as megawatts of PV in Alternating Current output.

In 2024 alone the countrys national power grid has collapsed ten times leaving millions without electricity. The most recent blackout triggered by weak infrastructure and sabotage underscores an enduring energy crisis that hinders economic growth and development. But beneath the surface lies a critical question why hasnt one of the worlds most resourcerich nations been able to build a resilient energy system The answer lies in a combination of internal challenges and external pressuresmost notably the influence of climate colonialism where global financial institutions and wealthy nations dictate energy policies that prioritize carbon reduction over human development. Despite having over 200 million people Nigerias energy system is woefully underdeveloped. The country has the capacity to generate up to 13000 megawatts MW of electricity but weak infrastructure allows for the transmission of only 4000 MW. This is less than 0.02 MW per personbarely enough to power basic household appliances. To fill the gap households and businesses generate an estimated 40000 MW using costly gasolinepowered generators. This overreliance on smallscale generation is neither efficient nor sustainable. Yet international financing for largescale fossil fuel infrastructuresuch as natural gasfired power plantshas dried up. Instead funds are increasingly directed toward renewable energy projects that fail to meet Nigerias baseload energy needs. In recent years wealthy nations and global institutions have adopted aggressive decarbonization policies with a growing refusal to fund fossil fuel development in poorer countries. This policy shift disproportionately affects nations like Nigeria which lack the financial resources to replace fossil fuels with expensive renewable technologies. For example These restrictions come at a time when Nigeria is desperate to modernize its grid. Renewable energy sources like wind and solar while useful for localized power generation cannot replace the reliability of fossil fuels for baseload power. Worse still attempts to accelerate a renewable transition have backfired. Solar panel installations for instance have proven difficult to maintain with failure rates exceeding 30 in certain regions within five years. Compounding the crisis is the physical vulnerability of Nigerias grid infrastructure. Armed groups frequently vandalize transmission lines exacerbating the already fragile system. Just last month insurgents disrupted power to the northern regions for over a week. This raises a bitter irony while international policymakers insist on eliminating fossil fuels to combat suppose climate change Nigeria continues to burn more diesela more carbonintensive fueljust to keep the lights on. As it stands diesel generators account for nearly 20 of Nigerias carbon emissions. This misguided approach highlights the failure of climate colonialism to achieve its purported environmental goals. Developed nations climate mandates for the Global South are fraught with hypocrisy. While countries like Germany reopened coal plants in 2023 to address energy shortages they preach renewableonly policies to developing nations. Similarly China the worlds largest coal consumer continues to fund its industrial growth with fossil fuels while promoting solar exports to Africa. Such policies not only stall Nigerias development but also entrench global inequalities. By forcing developing nations to rely on unreliable and expensive renewables wealthier countries maintain their industrial advantage. Nigerias energy crisis is emblematic of the broader challenges facing the Global South. To address this several measures are needed The blackouts crippling Nigeria are not merely technical failures they are the direct result of a global energy agenda that prioritizes ideology over pragmatism. By imposing stringent antifossil fuel policies wealthy nations and international organizations effectively bar Nigeria from leveraging its own resources to lift millions out of poverty. For Nigeria the path forward must involve rejecting externally imposed solutions and embracing a developmentfirst approach to energy policy. Only by asserting its right to define its own energy future can Nigeria escape the darkness of climate colonialism and unlock its true potential. Another factor is the misanthropy of the Green Blob. Third World peasants should stay in mud or thatch huts and do not really need electricity. Wasnt there some greenblob clown that said it would be dangerous to give them reliable electricity Paul Ehrlich of The Population Bomb infamy wrote that having cheap and abundant electricity would be like giving a machine gun to an idiot. They also love the taste of food cooked over a cowpie fire. Nigerian endemic corruption might have something to do with it. But those Nigerian princes regularly have LOTS of money to give away according to the emails I occasionally get. If I remember it was Obama who started the trend of banning investment in fossil fuelled electricity by the developing world. Like lemmings the rest of the world followed. Quite simply you cannot build a stable society without having a stable electricity supply. That means COAL or GAS for a start and possibly hydro if you have the rainfall and terrain. The greenblob has a lot to answer for for insisting on them just using unreliable electricity supplies and only providing funding for junk supply.. bnice But you must remember that Progressives are not responsible for unintended consequences even if warned in advance since they had good intentions. They think they are Saving the planet Any other group who promoted a policy that affected the poor or people of color this way would be castigated by the Media as racist xenophobes or worse. Actively restricting life saving reliable energy is immoral. They should be shamed ridiculed at every oppurtunity. What chance the new regime in USA can untie the funding shackles 4000MW between 200 million people is surely 20W per person Ecocolonialism It seems the ecomentalists believe some black lives dont matter I would think that they would be able to get some money to build out their grid infrastructure under the guise of putting infrastructure in place to support renewable energy projects. After all you cant do renewables without a massive grid. Would it be their fault if after the grid was built the weatherdependent generation never materialized Clearly the Nigerian people need help but dumping endless dollars into corruptly run countries is counter productive. We need to stop that. If we can determine that we can actually help Nigeria the easy thing to do for the uUnited States would be to divert the money we piss away on things like the World Bank and other outfits like that and use those dollars to build new generators fossil fuel or nuclear which ever is appropriate. Dont try to do the whole country choose one district help them achieve 247 power with stable transmission that can be defended. Once that district begins to thrive I am convinced other districts will want even demand the same and we are on our way. Most importantly we tell all those world organizations to take a hike.

This time the money is the big thing and it is amazingly crazy. They want many trillions from us starting next year. That people take this nonsense seriously speaks volumes about the unreality of the UN climate program. But it will be great fun to watch them hit the NO WAY wall. There are actually three big money issues to watch fail. First is the annual money for nothing from developed countries to developing ones that is supposed to jump from a measly 100 billion a year to a trillion a year and quickly growing to almost two trillion. I am not making this up. Second is the as yet untold trillions we are supposed to pay the developing countries to make up for their bad weather. Which of these two is crazier is hard to say and I welcome suggestions. Third is perhaps the most fun. People want China one of the strongest economies in the world to stop pretending to be a developing country and put big money into these two pots. By some measures China is by far the strongest economy. For example they produce and use more electricity than the US and EU combined. Before getting further into the greenback craziness a procedural point must be made especially with Trump coming on. This big money stuff is about the MOP not the COP. Hows that for jargon The basis for these annual discussions is the 1994 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC. This is a treaty ratified by 198 countries including the US. The abbreviation COP stands for the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC. The Paris Agreement is a 2015 supplement to the UNFCCC. It is not a treaty just what is called a Presidential Agreement in international law. President Trump cannot get us out of the UNFCCC but he can easily leave the Paris Agreement as he did last time he was Pres. Getting together under the Paris Agreement is called the Meeting of the Parties or the MOP. COP 29 is actually part COP and part MOP. All three big money issues are on the MOP side where we will soon be absent. Off course the COP 29 MOP is under what is left of the Biden Administration so we will still be at the table but any promises made will be laughed at. This twist just adds to the frivolity. Heres a bit more on the jargon so you can follow the action. First the astronomical annual payment issue is called the New Collective Quantified Goal or NCQG which strikes me as unpronounceable. Suggestions welcome. At least there is an interior rhyme with C and G. For purpose of discussion the starting value of the NCQG is 1.1 trillion in 2025 rising to 1.8 trillion in 2019. Yes it is a 5 year plan. No surprise there right The second big money issue is called Loss and Damage. This bad weather pot is just getting off the ground or trying to which may not happen so there is a lot to watch. The problem is there is more bad weather than money in the world so even possible funds are limited. Thus the basic issue is who gets how much and for what There are no actual funds at this point. So the debate is entirely academic which diplomats love. The Chinese issue seems to have no formal name but it is often termed as Chinas contribution. That China is the worlds biggest CO2 emitter also plays into the guilt trip. Chinas answer is that on a per capita basis they are still developing and have a long way to go. We shall see. Mind you diplomats never say NO so that will not happen. They just never say YES. Watch for it in slow motion since they have two weeks to kill. The money is laughably impossible and the US is pulling out of the MOP but the show must go on. Stay tuned to CFACT for a lot of fun to come. Someones going to have to get James Taylor to play for free. With Taylor Swift. But wasnt he so vain Nah he was Sweet Baby James Well the Commonwealth got into the UK first with 1.8Tn for slavery reparations so the UN can get to the back of the Queue. Now we just have to put a claim for 2.0Tn into Norway Sweden and Denmark for the Viking invasion and we are at a positive 0.2Tn. Dublin was the centre of the Viking slave trade for the British Isles so they could be added in too. Im still waiting for my share of the reparations due to black Africans driving my ancestors out of Africa into the frozen north Maybe we can deduct it from the money theyve asked for And whilst were at it lets deduct the billions weve already given them in aid theyll owe us Cant we also claim from the French for the Norman conquest And the Italians for the Roman invasion The German vandals invaded Europe and pushed all government to Constantinople. They all owe us for their crimes. The German vandals. And they are still vandalising Germany Money laundering. A duff kop The US cannot sign up to anything at this particular junket so my guess is few others if any will. Already its a repeat of the last one An official with Azerbaijans Presidency of next weeks United Nations COP29 climate summit appeared to offer to facilitate talks about new fossil fuel deals ahead of the conference according to a video secretly recorded by an advocacy group. httpswww.straitstimes.comworldeuropecop29hostazerbaijanpromotedfossilfueldealsaheadofclimatesummitngosays One could reasonably ask of them why bother You can bet Miliband will be leading the way The U.S. delegates are dejected but that wont stop them from enjoying one last party at least for a few years. They can still enjoy the 5 delights of a cop and network cops usually attract women of the night too. They certainly turned up in Glasgow. Its the economy stupid. We will still send delegates to the COP just not the MOP. You cant blame Azerbaijan. Its not their fault that they own one of the worlds largest gas fields Shah Deniz in the Caspian sea and that they rely on fossil fuels for almost half their GDP for over half of government revenues and more than 90 of the countrys export earnings. Theyre working on it honestly My first thought when someone demands money is to direct them to perform a highly improbable act upon themselves. money for nothing And your chicks for free Them guys aint dumb Dire Straits Money for Nothing And your chicks for free Some chicks work it. Im this naive innocent girl who wants to be an actress. Im willing to stop at nothing. Daisy Bowfinger 1999 I have said this before and I say it again regarding the trillions of the developed nations are supposed to dole out Marxist wealth redistribution by any other name is still Marxism. With Trump coming back into office it is likely that this scheme can be safely laughed off here in the U.S. Just listening to the Albany NY NPR the chatterers there sound as if Htler just won the election. My guess and I could be wrong is Albany NY NPR is for theythem Many similar types need mental help. I do hope that the rich famous that said they would move to another country do so. NPR talkingheads likely dont have the freedommoney to do so. That saddens me. Getting together under the Paris Agreement is called the Meeting of the Parties or the MOP. How bout The MOB Meeting of the Bureaucrats Maybe it could be something better than Bureaucrats but that will have to do for now. Meeting of the Bludgers We wont put up and they wont shut up. Got it. Again predestined to failure. Each COP gets more absurd than the last but the UNFCC doesnt seem to mind. Joke is on them. In the US Point 5. Trump promised to surrender and Putin is happy to accept. Now watch the Taiwan change position as its clear the USA will no protect them from China. Then watch the Tech Giants move from the USA to where they can access the silicon chips.

Taiwan has never been part of mainland China territory. I dont remember our founding fathers declaring war against Russia or China. And I suppose youve forgotten Americas 1994 promise to Ukraine. It would be nice to get the Ukraine war stopped while there are still some Ukrainian people left alive to enjoy it. Dishonour before death Surely that should be Ukraines decision.

Scuttlebutt about Newsoms special legislative session is that it will be the first step to succession from the Union. Maybe California will ask China for military support to complete the process. California has already signed trade agreements with China and signed Climate agreements with other States which violate Article I Section 10 of the US Constitution. So secession from the Union is not far behind that. Newsom likes to play stupid games. Just ask his former best friend and campaign manager Alex Tourk who also served as Newsoms deputy chief of staff.

Quora isnt deterred by the election results suggesting a new climate discussion paradigm when it comes to censoring my postings that dont resonate with their progressive bias. I quit counting when the 100th automatically declined submission hit a few months ago. Heres todays arrival Automatically declined Submitted October 25 Answer Is there still hope or any good news for the climate Hearing the new U.N report that we are headed for 3 degrees Celsius by 2100 has left me hopeless for good now. What is the point of anything I continue to be amazed that the IPCC has not been successfully sued perhaps by a wealthy family whom had lost a child to suicide from despair believing the climate alarmist lies. The conspicuous climate data manipulation in support of their blatantly obvious political objectives is criminal. There is not going to be 3C of warming 76 years from now and there isnt a credentialed PhD climate scientist alive who doesnt know it even though 97 of them wont admit it. Two degrees of warming from a doubling of ATM CO2 is an absolute maximum according to my reading of Dr. Roy Spenser. If FFs are to blame for that temperature increase its a nonissue because well be mostly nuclear long before we would ever get to 2X 425 PPM 850 PPM. In 2100 we wont even be at 650 PPM and because the CO2Temperature relationship is logarithmic we should expect 1C of warming or less. Delete Sure glad the UN stopped all that starving the worlds little children were experiencing through UNICEF President Trump cannot get us out of the UNFCCC Why not What happens if US resiles from that agreement does the UN send in the blue helmets Efficiency measures used to block payment to UNFCCC and all other climate and UN groups. Would be nice to watch the response There is no real evidence that CO2 has any effect on our global climate system. The AGW hypothesis has been falsified by science. Mankind does not even know what the optimum global climate is let alone how to achieve it. Hence spending money to fight climate change is a big waste of funds. The federal government of the USA is more than 35 trillion dollars in debt. The USA does not have any money to waste trying to fight climate change. If they really want to reduce CO2 emissions then they should hold their meetings over the Internet. The technology to do so has been available for decades..

Unfortunately the joke is on the UK as this farce comes with a hefty price tag for everyday Brits. Strap in folks because this is where green pipe dreams meet the cold hard wall of reality. The National Electricity System Operator NESO has essentially dropped a truth bomb on Milibands fantasy. Lets recap the highlights While Miliband fantasizes about a carbonfree paradise ordinary Brits are stuck with the billliterally. Green levies on electricity are set to rise by an extra 120 per household annually. Thats right youre funding this delusion one painful payment at a time. And as the pace of wind power contracts accelerates those levies will only go up because why not pile more weight on the middle class But wait theres more The entire plan hinges on gas prices hitting 100p per therm and carbon prices tripling by 2030. Right now gas is priced at a far more modest 70p per therm with carbon stuck at 38 per ton. Unless Miliband has a crystal ballor a way to manipulate global energy marketsthese numbers dont pencil out. Lets talk offshore wind the cornerstone of this green utopia. NESO insists we need to contract as much offshore capacity in two years as we did in the last six. Ambitious Try laughable. Even if every turbine magically appeared on time wed still rely on gas to set prices nearly half the time. So for all the expense and upheaval youre barely making a dent in volatile gas pricing. Brilliant. Heres the harsh truth Ed Milibands plan is a house of cards built on shaky assumptions. It assumes gas prices will soar the International Energy Agency thinks the opposite. It assumes well build infrastructure faster than ever before despite worker shortages and community resistance. It assumes carbon prices will triple without triggering a political revolt. And all of this for what To cut gas pricing from 58 of the time to47. Thats not progress thats rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. Milibands proposal isnt a planits an ideological fever dream dressed up as policy. Its the kind of scheme only a true leftist could love long on promises short on math and guaranteed to make your life harder. While elites sip their soy lattes and pat themselves on the back youre left footing the bill for their green fantasies. The NESO report doesnt just poke holes in Milibands visionit torpedoes it. So lets stop pretending this plan is anything other than what it is a colossal joke at the expense of the British public. You deserve better than this shameless grift. If Ed Miliband wants to play superhero he should stick to Halloween costumes not your heating bill. Meanwhile in Germany Im so thankful that we dodged that bullet in the U.S. Im so saddened for Germany however. Germany has been smug and arrogant for years. But they have good words Schadenfreude. I realized the situation in Germany was bleak a little over a year ago when flying out of Munich the only beer choice in the economy cabin was Michelob Ultra. I can only imagine Tante Angelas face Agreed but it may be premature. The Progressives are firmly entrenched in the administrative state aka deep state so they wont go quietly and the enviromental NGOs are flush with money to fund lawsuits to halt any rollback in current policies. The new administration will need to do the hard work of changing the laws not just a blizzard of Executive Orders as important as those are. As to Germany deindustrialization will not be pretty. And I note that in the video there was no suggestion to be able to defend your home with all those emergency supplies. Lol Its the same story across all government departments. No plan other than making life difficult for the many not the fewdal. Britains plans to become a clean energy superpower will not come cheap. Figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility have estimated that the levies used to support renewable energy projects are expected to rise from 12bn in the year 202425 to 14.8bn in the year 202930. However reducing Britains reliance on volatile global gas markets could help costs to fall overall. Neso has estimated that the wholesale market cost of electricity could fall by more than 10 by using more cheap renewable energy and less gasfired power. httpswww.theguardian.combusiness2024nov05whatwilltheukscleanenergyby2030planmeanfortheindustryandpublic The dunkelflaute hasnt shifted. These people are mad and theyve got a big majority. And they cant be recalled before the next election. Renewables are not cheap. They dont seem like a real political party. They seem to be a civil service trade union political arm. The mechanism is the party awards pay to the unions who then bung it back or some of it in the form of campaign contributions. Its old fashioned machine politics with British characteristics. And with a sort of lunatic fringe of farleft activists in this case with an obsession with getting to net zero because climate though they never explain what the UK getting to net zero in generation is going to do for the climate. Liberal arts graduates grabbing at every crazed woke fashion out of America. They do the student politics of protest. Dont forget the bn going to a place at war never to be seen again. Elections have consequences Unfortunately for England they will have to pay dearly for some time to rectify this dilemma. Today here in the UK wind power is generating all of 1.5GW of electricity. It has been at this useless level for the past week the extension leads we have plugged into the French nuclear fleet of generators along with our own for now gas fired generators have been carrying the demand load. Solar in this past week has been below measurement levels. That is the reality here in the UKs real world. Miliband and his ilk by contrast are living in a make believe Alice in Wonderland place and think their wishesdreams can be translated into our real world. They cant. The Everly Brothers hit song Dream is running through my head as a I write this. All I have to do is Dream dream dream dream.. Thursday probably averaged 5GW and Friday 4GW but yes not exactly performing. And 3 or 4 days had very low output indeed. And solar PV has been particularly poor because of the time of year mostly but also the gloom. For those who might be interested the gridwatch website shows the contribution of wind and solar to our electricity demand during the present dunkelflaute. httpsgridwatch.co.uk Yes How anyone can think you can run a country on wind and solar given this But they do. Well since the 1st November gas has supplied about 3.2TWh. Over 5 times as much as wind. Maximum from gas was 23.5GW on the other hand Wind 7.5GW. Minimums 4.3GW and 0.6GW. Currently 19.7GW and 1.7GW And solar PV has been particularly poor because of the time of year mostly but also the gloom. Until I read this i was sure Id managed to mess up my data copying and preprocessing procedure. Has it really been that cloudy foggy given the lack of Wind as well as Solar back in Blighty for the last 9 days or so The UK leads the world at one thing httpspbs.twimg.commediaGbzSNSWYAcmuzHformatjpgnamemedium httpswww.express.co.uknewsuk1973497graphukelectricitypricescomparedworld There are as few people in my domain who believe in Green policy and even fewer who would trust ANY politician let alone the liar Miliband and his typically unfit for purpose Party. Miliband is agenda led as are most UK politicians and the agenda hasnt yet negotiated its infantile beginnings which rest in the improbability that we know enough about climate and weather to make predictions of any worth for the future. The most efficient fuel is the one we should burn for whatever task we have.. Back in the twentieth century we predicted that life would be unsupportable unless we stopped burning fossil fuel and yet here we are still burning it. We could have had a nuclear UK long ago if there really had been a problem with fossil fuel. Politicians and their favoured scientists cannot be trusted because they gain far too much power and money from the agendas they push. We needed intelligent political leaders but it seems they do not exist in our main parties. Its time to pin our politicians down with awkward questions of what the risks of burning fossil fuel in the UK are when our quota is so tiny and almost immeasurable compared to the many others. .. Actually you needed intelligent business leaders. Hopefully we in the U.S.A. will have one safefully in place in late January. UKWeather Lass there was a plan over twenty yeras ago to have a nuclear programme for the U.K.. However our technically illiterate politicians and their advisors went for the apparently cheaper wind generation. If they had the humility and sense to get an understanding first of how the grid works that decision would not have been made and we would be in far better place. As it is we are aiming to hugely increase these second and third rate generators. Just because some devices can generate electricity does not mean they are suitable or even a replacement for conventional generation because they are not. Initially they went for gas because it was quicker to instal nuclear was shunned because it was more expensive in the short term ie needed more cash up front though worked out cheaper in the long run. Those nuclear stations they didnt build would all be working by now if theyd gone ahead Dont worry chaps Millibrain has it all figured out Whilst this week Wind has only produced c. 25 of the electricity for the UK he is going to build many many more thousands so come another Dunkelflaute he will have resolved the problem. I think Starmer may even Knight him for this excellent idea I do believe Labour have many more geniuses lined up with other great ideas like David Lammy. I bet not many of you could have managed all the scrutiny under the bright lights of Mastermind Any Primary schoolchild could have made the same mistakes under pressure or . BTW can someone amend Wikipedia to update HenryVIII successor as Henry VII. I just dont have the time or inclination s 25 Its only got close to that on one day this week and was less that 5 on Tuesday. How much storage would we have needed to get through this week alone with a 100 renewables grid 650GWh 195000000000 using batteries for Tuesday alone 4TWh 1200000000000 for the week and thats without any safety margin and it looks like this could persist into next week. Whilst this week Wind has only produced c. 25 of the electricity for the UK Enter annoying pedant mode Theres no such thing as the UK grid theres the island of Great Britain GB grid operated by ESO and the island of Ireland grid operated by EirGrid. Ill assume youre talking about the GB grid here. Exit annoying pedant mode as much as that is possible in my case . Attached is a graph extracted from my daily accumulators spreadsheet. I agree with Idle Eric PS See also my reply to MrGrimNasty who was replying to Rod Evans 3 or 4 toplevel posts above this one. On the bright side for Ed an awful lot of cheap lightly used windmills could be on the secondhand market from January. If Miliband wants sustainable green energy he needs to get building big nuclear fast and not wait for modular reactors. Stop wasting money on wind and solar and get fracking and drilling and mining while encouraging the market to find cheaper technologies before fossil fuels run out whenever that is. The earth isnt dying it never was.come clean about that. For that to happen Ed Miliband would have to admit that he was wrong about renewable energy. That is never going to happen. The only solution is for Keir Starmer to perform one of his famous Uturns and sack Miliband. That would be a good idea I remember when Milliband passed the Climate Change Act in late October it snowed in London which is very unusual at that time of year its as if the gods wanted to remind him who is boss Reality never visits itself on these people. Starmer seems to be every bit as committed to Net Zero as Mad Ed hes already brought the phaseout for ICE cars forward to 2030 perhaps more significantly the only thing he really seems to be interested in is international agreements so the fact that weve committed to Net Zero means hes committed too. The only hope is Starmer gets ousted for someone else and Mad Ed follows him out the door to be replaced by someone with the ability to do simple maths. Right now in the UK we have this gas 55 of supply 18.6 GW wind 5 of supply 1.65 GW from about 30 GW installed total demand is 34 GW Some biomass some nuclear 14 some interconnect. A bit of solar 3 which will vanish at 4 pm. So imagine its 2030 weekday at 4pm January. Total demand is now 50 GW. Wind now that Ed has got it up to 90 GW is doing 5 GW. Be optimistic maybe its doing 10 GW. Its dark there is no solar. Its cold around 2 C. The heating and the stoves and the EV charging are being turned on. Gas has been turned off as it reached end of life nuclear was decommissioned in 20278. The country has demand at least 30 GW over generation. Its a nationwide blackout. What other possibility is there httpwww.gridwatch.co.uk Pricing will be less determined by gas because falling CCGT capacity means that all gas will already be in use on less windy days. Prices will instead be set by what is needed to secure supply via interconnectors or to price out demand forcing it offline. That is why Time of Use tariffs and metering are being imposed. We have already seen markets operating in this mode during the energy crisis. It is a convenient fiction to blame the result on gas prices. Futures gas prices show the effect of anticipated increases in global LNG supply with prices for 2031 55ptherm for NBP being about half of the current prices for this winter. However when the UK depends on imported power the price will depend on costs at the other end of the interconnectors or the prices at which they are prepared to curtail demand to supply the interconnectors. The other side of the coin is that when it is windy there will be larger and larger curtailed surpluses and spot prices will be low or negative. That just means that subsidies will be bigger and that there will be side payments on a grand scale for ancillary services to try to keep the grid stable. Again pricing will not be set by gas. It will not be set by the price of gas per se but by the operators. They need to recoup their capex as well as their fuel costs. The more wind there is the less in theory they will be used but the size of the plant to step in remains the same so total capex remains the same. So prices must be increased to recover capex on a smaller amount of power. IOW the more wind there is the higher the price of gas must go so prices go up. The NESO runs with a Capacity Market which supposedly provides the income for dispatchable plant to keep maintained and available paid regardless of how often they are dispatched. Compare ERCOT which is an energy only market with no capacity payments. The price offered into the market for gas based generation is thus largely based on fuel cost plus green taxes unless they are able to shadow price because all gas capacity is called on and prices are set by a more costly source or demand destruction. Sometimes they will get paid to generate to provide ancillary services particularly inertia and short circuit current. The problem we face is that there has been underprocurement of dispatchable capacity so we will be seeing more frequent cases of domestic market shortage. In the same way wind and solar have to earn their keep. That is done by subsidising them either via a guaranteed fixed inflation indexed price for CFDs and FiTs or with an inflation indexed subsidy per MWh generated ROCs. Those on the highest subsidies have no incentive to curtail unless their subsidy is reimbursed. The ones on the lowest subsidies and thus cheapest to run get to be first to curtail because they need less palm grease. More recent CFDs have clauses that offer no compensation at all if the day ahead price goes negative so these operations will become first in line to curtail as capacity increases. Moreover the volume of curtailment will start increasing rapidly as more capacity is added. At the same time the CFDs prevent participating in any upside when supply is tight when in any case output is likely to be low being the reason for the supply tightness. The financial performance of these newer operations is likely to be very disappointing under the current regime. Many have tried to delay commencing their CFDs as long as they can under the contract in order to take market prices that tend to offer a better average outcome compared with their foolishly low bid prices on their CFD. The growth in curtailment means that renewables will get to be very costly and require lots of extra subsidy if they are to survive. It doesnot add up we need gas it is the only source of demand and load balancing which must be done on an instantaneous basis we have. You cannot keep a grid operational without something to keep it in balance. None of the other inputs have the capability or capacity necessary. This simple fact seems to have been forgotten. Pricing will be less determined by gas because falling CCGT capacity means that all gas will already be in use on less windy days. Prices will instead be set by what is needed to secure supply via interconnectors or to price out demand forcing it offline. That is why Time of Use tariffs and metering are being imposed. We have already seen markets operating in this mode during the energy crisis. It is a convenient fiction to blame the result on gas prices. Futures gas prices show the effect of anticipated increases in global LNG supply with prices for 2031 55ptherm for NBP being about half of the current prices for this winter.

That just means that subsidies will be bigger and that there will be side payments on a grand scale for ancillary services to try to keep the grid stable. Again pricing will not be set by gas. Not sure why the post got duplicated. Claiming there will be a 300 reduction in a far future bill is amongst the sleaziest rhetorical tricks being pulled. There is no way to know if a bill in 2030 is 300 less than it would have been. It could be 3000 more and they could still claim victory Because it isnt 3300. And if they do feel a moral obligation to visibly knock 300 off our bill they can just pay a portion of it out of general taxation and more likely borrowing and say Look 300 off. They probably wont do that though. If my 2030 bill goes down by 300 in 2024 terms it will most likely be as a result of reduced consumption owing to demand management rationingblackouts. Or reinstate the Winter Fuel Allowance and bingo you have reduced the winter fuel bill for pensioners by 200. This and Donald Trumps election reminds me of the Scottish independence fiasco back in 2014. Alex Salmond was insistent that Scotland could afford independence because oil was 100 a barrel and the trajectory was only upward. The independence lunge failed as clear thinking Scots understood it was a busted flush and voted to remain in union with the rest of the UK. Almost immediately afterward the price of a barrel of oil crashed to 30 and if i recall correctly the oil companies couldnt give the stuff away. With Trump back as POTUS and willing to drill baby drill we are likely to see the OG price fall which I believe will make wind and solar simply way to expensive for any rational nation to even consider. Dr. John Constable of the GWPF Global Warming Policy Foundation predicted around 3 years ago that within 5 10 years there wouldnt be a functional wind turbine left anywhere in the UK. Yes the price in short delivery went negative as the tankers got filled 100 and there was nowhere for the oil to go. If you could find an empty tanker it could name its price to take on the oil and then just sit there. That happened to the WTI price at Cushing and Midland where the tankage and export pipeline capacities are constraints. It didnt happen to Brent prices because there are enough ships to take it away and in any event the low prices encouraged shutins for maintenance. Those caught were laregely financial speculators who had no capacity to take oil delivery and use it so had to sell out futures positions. Any still caught long would have had enormous costs of having to put up collateral for full value including potential losses if they had to pay a producer to shut in and they would have been beholden to whoever had rights to mainly Texaco storage. Having no expertise in trading physical oil rather than futures would have made them even more vulnerable to high costs. How nonsensical. Thanks goodness for Brexit. Corrigenda Brexit hasnt happened. Yet The 2023 electricity prices no m ore need be said. It is worse than it seems. GB News checked with Companies house to find the Controlling person on the board of NESO. Turns out that person is Ed Milliband himself. Conflict of interest does not come close to covering this fraud. A realistic view of the costs for Australia to hit the Nut Zero nirvana of the Labor Government httpswww.youtube.comwatchvsRhNOv1Uo4M Gerard Holland lays out the staggering cost of renewable energy at ARC Australia Another fly in the ointment for Ed Miliband which he is probably as unaware of as he is of most things is that the offshore wind manufacturers are having a torrid time at the moment. In August Equinor pulled out of its offshore projects in Spain and Portugal having previously exited Vietnam and also said it was considering exiting other markets. It told Reuters Its getting more and more expensive and we think things are going to take more time in quite a few markets around the world httpswww.offshore.wind.biz20240829equinoraxesoffshorewindplansinspainandportugalweighsfurthermarketexits Then in OctoberGE Vernova announced changes in our Offshore wind business globally. 900 jobs were at risk. The proposal reflects wide challenges for wind and aims to transform our offshore wind business into a smaller leaner and more profitable business With this move the company aims to return its offshore wind business to profitability They also noted That many of the issues were industry wide and that their competitors were facing similar challenges httpswww.offshore.wind.biz20241002gevernovaslimmingdownoffshorewindbusinessmovecouldimpact900employees Not one red number no red flag quite sad really. I always look for the counter argument on here but it seems there isnt one sole solitary redeeming feature of Ed Millibands folly.

The International Energy Agency IEA estimates that electricity demand from AI data centers and crypto currency could more than double by 2026 an added equivalent of all the electricity used in Sweden or in the highusage case Germany. Consequently large AI tech companies which require reliable 247 power are looking seriously at partnering with or owning nuclear facilities that they can count on kindling hope that such developments will drive longoverdue investments to develop safer more efficient technologies to address increasingly critical national needs. As Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner Mark Christie warned in April The problem is that utilities are rapidly retiring fossilfuel and nuclear plants. We are subtracting dispatchable fossil fuel resources at a pace thats not sustainable and we cant build dispatchable resources to replace the dispatchable resources were shutting down. Subject to government regulatory approval tech giant Microsoft is entering into a deal with Constellation Energy to refurbish and reopen one of two dormant reactors at its Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania by 2028. The fouryear restart plan would cost Constellation about 1.6 billion and is dependent on federal subsidies in the form of tax breaks earmarked for nuclear power in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. If approved by regulators Three Mile Island would provide Microsoft with the energy equivalent it takes to power 800000 homes or 835 megawatts. The IEA report forecasts that peak electricity demand in the U.S. will grow by 38 gigawatts by 2028 roughly equivalent to 46 times the output of one reactor at Three Mile Island. Microsoft has agreed to use as much power as possible from the plant over the next 20 years. That reactor had operated safely up until five years ago before closing for economic reasons having been reopened after the other reactor partly melted down in 1979 fueling great public concern about nuclear safety risks. In addition as reported in The Washington Post Microsoft is also pursuing power from nuclear fusion a potentially abundant cheap and clean form of electricity that scientists have been trying to develop for decades. While noting most say it is still a decade or more away from generating electricity the Post observes that Microsoft is ahead of the game in having signed a contract to buy fusion energy from a startup that claims it can deliver it by 2028. The number of U.S. operating nuclear fission reactors peaked at 112 in 1990 then declined to 92 by 2022. The latest new one the Vogtle power plant in Georgia took more than 14 years to build. As noted by Bloomberg the Microsoft deal is the latest sign of surging interest in the nuclear industry as power demand for AI soars. Over the past decade over a dozen nuclear reactors have gone dark in the face of increasing competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. But now Bloomberg adds the growing demand for electricity especially from data centers has led many to turn to nuclear plants that can provide carbonfree power around the clock. The rise of ChatGPT and similar largelanguage AI models require huge amounts of computing power which has turbocharged datacenter demand. Dominion Energy which supplies electricity to most of the Virginia data centers projects their power requirements to quadruple over the next 15 years representing 40 of the utilitys demand in the entire state. Meanwhile according to The Wall Street Journal electricity demand by power data centers is projected to increase by 13 to 15 compounded annually through 2030. Nevertheless power shortages are already delaying new centers by two to six years. These potentially lengthy timescales are part of the reason why Microsoft is interested in developing small modular reactors which should be quicker and cheaper to build. By comparison China seems to build nuclear power plants much more quickly so speeding up is possible meaning that to remain competitive the U.S. must step up its game. In March Amazon Web Services closed a deal similar to Microsofts acquiring a data center campus connected to Talen Energy Corp.s nuclear power plant on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania for 650 million. Last week the DOE has also announced it has finalized a 1.52 billion loan guarantee to help Holtec International reopen a shuttered Palisades nuclear plant in Covert Township Michigan which ceased operating in 2022. Two rural electricity providers that planned to buy power from the reactor would also receive 1.3 billion in federal grants under a program already approved by Congress. Regarding the Microsoft deal with his company Constellation CEO Joseph Dominguez told The Washington Post This plant never should have been allowed to shut down. . . . It will produce as much clean energy as all of the renewables wind and solar built in Pennsylvania over the last 30 years. The symbolism Dominguez added is enormous whereby even though Three Mile Island was the site of the nuclear industrys greatest failure it can now be a place of rebirth. Lets sincerely hope hes right.

Dead wrong Wind or solar costs around five times more per megawatt hour compared to for example natural gas. We are told that wind and solar will save us from a climate catastrophe. If there is a looming climate catastrophe the only thing that will save us is nuclear power. Wind and solar are incredibly expensive methods of reducing CO2 emissions. The more wind and solar you build the cost of removing CO2 increases disproportionately. The U.S. has wasted 1.5 trillion on wind and solar and for that money only a little more than 10 of our electricity comes from wind and solar. Fossil fuels are not dirty. Modern natural gas or coal plants are environmentally pristine. CO2 is not a pollutant but an aerial plant food that is greening the Earth. CO2 makes plants grow faster with less water. Wind or solar electricity is not worth what it costs to create it. It is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. That is a generally accepted economic principle. If the government requires a utility to purchase some amount of electricity at some price that is not a free market. That is central planning. Central planning has a role but it rarely works as well as the voluntary exchange of goods and services. Central planning creates unexpected twists and turns and often results in low productivity. I will first discuss the value of wind and solar electricity in a free market and then discuss the effect of extensive government interventions via subsidies and mandates. Everywhere when commentators compare the cost of wind or solar electricity with the cost of fossil fuel electricity they use LCOE the levelized cost of electricity. It is a logical error to compare LCOE of natural gas with LCOE of wind or solar. The correct comparison is to compare the marginal cost of natural gas with the LCOE of wind or solar. The marginal cost of natural gas electricity is about 20 per megawatt hour in the U.S. The LCOE of wind or solar hovers around 100 per megawatt hour or about five times more. LCOE includes amortization of the cost of building the generating plant. The marginal cost is essentially the cost of the fuel to generate the electricity. Under what circumstances will a utility or grid operator be willing to purchase wind or solar electricity For the sake of the discussion we postulate that the utility is going to replace some of its natural gas electricity with wind or solar electricity. The argument would be the same if coal electricity is being replaced and different if hydroelectricity is being replaced. No one would replace nuclear electricity with wind or solar because nuclear fuel is too cheap. The utility cannot make a complete replacement scrapping a natural gas generating plant and replacing it with a wind or solar farm. That is impossible because wind and solar are erratic providing power subject to the weather and the daily solar cycle. Their erratic nature cannot be fixed at a remotely reasonable cost with batteries or pumped storage. The utility will be open to reducing output from a gas plant and replacing that electricity with wind or solar electricity when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing only If the wind or solar electricity is less expensive then the marginal cost of generating the electricity with the gas plant. Notice that I said marginal cost not LCOE. Marginal cost for a gas plant is almost entirely the cost of the fuel. If gas is 3 per MMBtu and the gas plant is a combined cycle plant the marginal cost of generating electricity is about 20 per megawatt hour. In countries that do not enjoy cheap natural gas the marginal cost will be higher. If the cost of the wind or solar electricity is greater than 20 it will be a money losing proposition to substitute wind or solar electricity for gas electricity. If it is less then it will be a profitable endeavor. The value of wind or solar is 20 per megawatt hour under these conditions. LCOE for a natural gas plant includes an allowance for the amortization of the initial investment. It also depends on the utilization or capacity factor of the plant. The capacity factor is not very relevant to the properties of natural gas generation because real utilities overprovision their generator capacity to account for peak demand and the possibility of plants being under repair. LCOE for a wind or solar farm is almost entirely capital cost spread over the number of megawatt hours generated with due consideration for the time value of money. The marginal cost is near zero because it costs nothing extra to generate an additional megawatt hour and nothing is saved if fewer megawatt hours are generated. If plant output is curtailed because the grid cannot accept all the wind or solar power available the cost per megawatt hour is proportionally increased. Overwhelming the grid with wind or solar is an increasingly serious problem. The Departure From a Free Market The most important government intervention is state renewable portfolio laws. These laws define renewable energy and set quotas for what proportion of the electricity in the state must be from renewable sources. Without getting too complicated renewable energy is usually defined as anything that is not fossil fuel nuclear energy or hydroelectricity involving dams. Most of the energy that passes that test is too expensive or not scalable. Wind and solar are too expensive and handicapped by intermittency but they are scalable. The result is that renewable energy is almost always wind or solar. A few states allow hydroelectricity with dams to be considered renewable. Hydro has limited scalability due to the best sites being already developed. Renewable portfolio laws mandate the purchase of an increasing proportion of renewable electricity. For example California requires that 60 of the electricity be from renewable sources by 2030. The second most important government intervention are federal subsidies tax credits and complicated tax provisions called tax equity financing that subsidize about 50 of the cost of building a wind or solar farm. Mandating the purchase of renewable electricity changes the nature of the market for renewable electricity. Without the mandates the owner of a wind or solar farm is doomed to beg utilities to purchase electricity for far less than it costs to generate. The farm would soon be bankrupt. But with mandates the utilities are knocking on his door begging for renewable power that they are mandated to purchase without regard to the price. Renewable portfolio laws change the market from a buyers market to a sellers market. There are a handful of companies with the expertise and financial resources to construct billiondollar utilityscale wind or solar farms. Although they nominally compete by bidding for the sale of electricity they constitute an oligopoly. That is to say that the competition will not be as vigorous as it would be if more players were in the market. The most common deal structure is that the developer constructs a wind farm and sells the electricity to the utility. Because the market is tipped in favor of the big companies they are able to require a longterm contract called a power purchase agreement or PPA usually 20 for years guaranteeing a market at a set price for all the electricity that the project can produce. That longterm market and price guarantee has tremendous value. The PPA is a subsidy because by removing market risk the farm becomes less like a business and more like a treasury bond. The price per megawatt hour can be less because a lower rate of return is viable. Risk has been removed. With the guaranteed market the farm becomes marketable to conservative investors like infrastructure funds or pension funds. I estimate that the PPA reduces the rate of return needed from 12 to 8 and thus subsidizes the cost of renewable electricity by a third. That subsidy is not cost free. The utility is assuming massive debt and risk by signing the PPA. There are plenty of possible reasons why utilities might want to get out of PPAs in five or ten years. For example lower cost nuclear electricity. Between renewable portfolio laws and federal subsidies the wind or solar farm is about 66 subsidized. For example if the LCOE of the wind or solar electricity is 100 per megawatt hour after the subsidies are applied it is 33 per megawatt hour. This is still more than the 20 that the electricity is worth. To close the gap the utility must raise its rates to pay for the extra 13 per megawatt hour. The final subsidy comes from the electricity customers. Justifications for Massive Subsidies The first justification is that reducing CO2 emissions will prevent a climate catastrophe. This justification fails for several reasons. Reducing American CO2 emissions will have little effect because the emissions problem is in Asia where emissions not only dwarf ours but are skyrocketing due to development of coal powered generation. The cost of reducing CO2 emissions by wind or solar is very high more than 300 per metric ton of CO2 removed. The subsidy is the cost of removing CO2. It becomes increasingly difficult to augment the amount of wind or solar above 50 due to their intermittent nature. Carbon offsets can be purchased for as little as 10 per ton although not enough would be available to neutralize CO2 emissions from the entire power system. Serious reduction of emissions at reasonable cost requires adopting nuclear power generally prohibited by renewable portfolio laws. The second justification is that fossil fuel or nuclear fuel will run out. Within the borders of the U.S. is enough fossil fuel for hundreds of years and nuclear fuel for thousands of years. It is not sensible to turn the economy upside down in anticipation of a theoretical event centuries in the future. A third justification is that fossil fuel plants cause air pollution and nuclear plants may release harmful radiation. Modern coal or natural gas plants are environmentally clean. Nuclear plants are proven by hundreds of plants running for decades. The worst accidents were easily contained. Finally the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere has greened the Earth and substantially increased agricultural production. CO2 is aerial plant food.

Lithium battery fires are breaking out on highways and in factories home garages and storage rooms. The rise in these fires is caused by government efforts to force the adoption of green energy. Lithium batteries have high energy density making them valuable for phones and portable appliances. But when they catch fire they burn with high heat and can even blow up. Thats why airlines prohibit lithium batteries in checked baggage. On June 24 a battery factory in Hwaseong South Korea caught fire triggering explosions and killing 22 workers. Experts estimate that most were killed by toxic gases emitted by the burning batteries. Scotland has suffered two major fires in batteryrecycling centers this year. On April 8 a large fire broke out at Fenix Battery Recycling in Kilwinning. More than 40 firefighters and personnel from six different stations responded to the blaze which burned for several days. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service urged nearby residents to remain indoors with windows closed as long as two days after the fire started. On June 23 a large fire broke out at the batteryrecycling facility of WEEE Solutions in Glasgow. Eyewitnesses reported explosions noises like gunshots steel flying everywhere and a huge plume of black smoke. Ten fire trucks were needed and the blaze lasted four days. Ebike battery fires are a leading cause of fires in New York City causing 270 blazes last year and killing 18 people. These have become a serious problem in Australia Canada and other nations as well. Ebicyclists often store their bikes in firstfloor storerooms where they can selfignite and destroy the buildings. Even highquality batteries are prone to selfignition after damage or when connected to a faulty charging system. Lithium batteries have been used for the past 30 years in phones and small appliances. But the introduction of electric cars led to a massive increase in battery sizeand potential destructiveness. On Aug. 19 a Tesla semi truck crashed into trees along Interstate 80 in California. The crash ignited the trucks large lithium battery. Firefighters required 50000 gallons of water to extinguish the flames and the highway was closed for 15 hours. The California Advanced Clean Fleets regulation passed last year requires all new semi trucks to be zeroemissions vehicles by 2036 which in practice means electric trucks with batteries prone to fire. Automakers have contended with lithiumbattery fires for more than a decade. Alfa Romeo BMW Ford General Motors Hyundai Porsche Tesla and other manufacturers have recalled millions of EVs because of batteryfire problems. Batteries can selfignite while the vehicle is in motion when connected to a charger or even when sitting in a parking lot. EVs prone to selfignition have been banned from parking lots in China South Korea and across the U.S. On Aug. 24 a fire broke out in the parking lot of EV manufacturer Rivian in Normal Ill. More than 50 vehicles were destroyed. The same plant also reportedly suffered three other battery fires in the last year and three more in 202122. On July 26 a truck containing several large lithium batteries ignited after a crash on Interstate 15 near Baker Calif. The road was shut down for 44 hours as firefighters worked to put out the blaze. Hundreds of motorists were stranded in the desert in 100degree heat. Ambulances and medical teams with fuel and water were dispatched to the site to help stranded motorists. How are governments responding to the rash of battery fires They are doubling down promoting the use of even larger highdensity lithium batteries as part of their efforts to phase out coal oil and natural gas in favor of wind and solar energy. Gridscale batteries are viewed as the solution to wind and solar intermittency. They store excess electricity when wind and solar output is high and release it when wind and solar output is low. The number of grid battery fires is growing and grid batteries are hundreds of times the size of EV batteries. On May 15 a Gateway Energy Storage facility using lithiumbattery storage caught fire near San Diego. Firefighters managed to get the blaze under control in 24 hours but it reignited twice more and burned for a total of 11 days. Evacuation orders to residents were issued and reissued. The Gateway facility was the largest of its kind when constructed in 2020. As a result of the fire San Diego County residents called for a moratorium on new battery storage facilities. But the countys Board of Supervisors voted the proposal down. Vice President Kamala Harris in 2022 announced 1 billion in grants for electric school buses. If a diesel bus engine catches fire the driver can usually put it out with a fire extinguisher. But this isnt possible with electric buses which explode when they catch fire. Policymakers need to pay more attention to the dangers of the greenenergy transition.

Rodrguez CarrilloGetty Images House Republicans are pressing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association NOAA for answers about a signature dataset frequently cited as evidence that climate change is intensifying. Members of the House Committee on Science Space and Technology Committee wrote to NOAA Administrator Richard Spinrad on Wednesday demanding information about several aspects of the agencys billion dollar disasters BDD dataset which the Biden administration has cited to justify its pause on natural gas export terminal approvals among other things. The lawmakers allege that the BDD data may be violating NOAAs scientific integrity rules and they also requested clarification on NOAAs methodology and an explanation as to why the agency does not adjust for variables like GDP. The metrics critics have pointed out that economic statistics are an inappropriate proxy for climate changes intensity or changing meteorological conditions. For example identical storms in identical locations at two different times would render different damage totals because of increases in the amount of property in harms way and not necessarily because climate change has gotten any worse. EXCLUSIVE Blatant Violations Watchdog Challenges Key Data Used By Biden Admin To Push Sweeping Climate Agenda NOAA Letter by Nick Pope Since the 1990s NOAA has published annual reports showing the number of disasters that have cost more than a billion dollars in damages the letter states. Debate around the validity of the reports methodologies has resulted in NOAA making incremental but important changes. Since 2011 the reports cost estimates of all past disasters in the dataset have been updated annually to account for inflation in todays dollars. However despite adjustments for inflation the reports have not been adjusted for increases in population or wealth in the same capacity the letter continues. Due to these increases in population and wealth even mild storms can sometimes appear to cause greater damage today. The lack of updated comprehensive data in these models raises considerable concern given that these reports have been cited by both Congress and the President as the justification for different federal government actions concerning climate change. BDD data was used in a flagship climate report released by the Biden administration in 2023 and it was also cited as evidence to justify the administrations pause on approvals for new liquefied natural gas export terminals by Deputy Energy Secretary David Turk in testimony provided to Congress in February. The letter alleges that NOAAs adjustments for inflation appear to be inconsistent in some cases. Additionally the lawmakers wrote that the opaque methodology for deriving BDD data makes the data nearly impossible to independently replicate and verify. The letters authors Republican Reps. Frank Lucas of Oklahoma Max Miller of Ohio and Jay Obernolte of California called on Spinrad to disclose why NOAA connects BDD data and climate change and the scientific basis it has for doing so as well as for an explanation as to why the agency does not adjust its data for increases in population or wealth. Roger Pielke Jr. a BDD critic and former environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado raised several of these issues in his own correction request submitted to NOAA in January. In response to his request NOAA said that it would be taking some steps to improve the BDD datas transparency. NOAA referred the Daily Caller News Foundation to the statement it issued upon releasing their response to Pielkes correction request when contacted for comment for this story. An agency spokesperson added that the agency will respond to the lawmakers letter via official channels. NOAA notes that the request for correction RFC did not identify specific data points that need correcting. In conducting its review of the RFC NOAA has not identified any data inaccuracies in the Billion Dollar Disaster data set an agency spokesperson said in a statement shared with the DCNF regarding Pielkes correction request. NOAA has determined the U.S. BillionDollar Weather and Climate Disasters data set meets the threshold for influential scientific information ISI under NOAAs Information Quality Guidelines. As a result NOAA will review and update its management practices for the data set.

Rodriguez CarrilloGetty Images The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA has committed to improving the documentation and transparency of a key data set frequently cited by activists and policymakers to suggest that climate change is getting worse. Roger Pielke Jr. a former environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado requested that NOAA correct its billion dollar disasters BDD dataset in January alleging that the datasets sourcing and methodology are not sufficiently transparent for the metric to inform policy. NOAA responded to Pielkes correction request on Aug. 21 admitting that the dataset has not undergone external peer review since 2015 and committing to improving its documentation and transparency of the datasets component parts going forward. BDD data keeps track of natural disasters that caused 1 billion or more in inflationadjusted damages going back to 1980 with NOAA and the Biden White House contending that the increasing frequency of BDD events evidences worsening climate change. However BDD is an economic statistic rather than an indicator of changing meteorological conditions the same exact hurricane could hit the same exact city 100 years apart but the damage totals for each storm would be vastly different given that there are more assets to be destroyed in harms way now than there were a century ago. RELATED Biden Admin Doubles Down On Dishonest Use Of Disaster Stats To Promote Climate Narrative NOAA BDD RFC Response by Nick Pope on Scribd In response to Pielkes request NOAA said it would start disclosing more of the publicly available sources that it uses to craft its data formalize and disclose the steps the agency takes to ensure the BDD datas robustness and set up a peerreview system that is consistent with NOAAs own policies. NOAA made some difficult admissions here about the fact that the BDD tabulation has failed to meet their standards for scientific integrity and information quality Pielke who believes climate change is a serious problem told the DCNF. The BDD tabulation is clever marketing and the media love it. However no one should mistake it as science. Pielke addressed NOAAs response to his request in an Aug. 21 post to his Substack page writing that these responses and admissions clearly indicate that the NOAA tabulation is not suitable for research. He added that NOAAs response to his correction request concedes that historical versions of the tabulation and thus new entries and changes to it are only available since 2020 meaning that 40 of almost 44 years of the tabulation lack basic information on the loss estimates and how they were originally compiled. While BDDs critics contend it is a flawed metric to use as a proxy for the intensity of climate change the statistic was used in a landmark climate report published by the Biden administration in 2023 and cited as evidence to support the administrations freeze on approvals for new liquified natural gas export terminals by Deputy Energy Secretary David Turk in written testimony submitted to Congress in February.

The new study titled Climate policies that achieved major emission reductions Global evidence from two decades used artificial intelligence to assess 1500 different climate policies pursued across 41 nations between 1998 and 2022 aiming to determine which types of policies have prompted significant emissions cuts. The studys analysis found that only 63 of these policies constituted successful policy interventions meaning that just 4 of the measures evaluated in the studys sample effectively reduced emissions. RELATED Supreme Court Delivers Massive Blow To Bidens Climate Agenda Dems Massive Green Energy Agenda Is Walking America Right Into Chinas Hands Analysis Claimshttpst.coYHH5A3e0fy Daily Caller DailyCaller August 27 2024 Across four sectors 41 countries and 2 decades we found 63 successful policy interventions with large effects that reduced total emissions between 0.6 and 1.8 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide the study states. Moreover most of the emissions cuts observed in the study were the result of two or more policies having a combined effect. We have a lot of policies out there that have not led to large emission reductions and more policies do not necessarily equate to better outcomes Nicholas Koch the head of the policy evaluation lab at Germanys Mercator Research Institute and one of the studys authors told NewScientist. What we observe is that the most frequently used policy tools which are subsidies and regulations alone are insufficient. Only in combination with pricebased instruments such as carbon prices energy taxes can they deliver substantial emission reductions. In other words subsidies and regulations generally will not compel economies to bring down emissions without complementary policies that directly tax energy use or impose outright bans on certain practices like burning coal to produce electricity according to Koch. Richard Tol an economics professor at Englands University of Sussex with expertise in the economics of climate policies told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the studys results are indicative of fundamental issues with green subsidies. If you estimate the impact of 1500 policies you would expect 75 of those to be statistically significant as a statistical fluke. They found only 63 Tol told the DCNF. Anyways subsidies can be effective in the short run less so in the long run as they make the offending activity more profitable. For example a subsidy on energy saving say home insulation makes energy cheaper so that people use more. Besides many green subsidies are designed to reward political allies rather than reduce emissions. Other critics of the Wests climate policies have pointed out that continued use of fossil fuels and especially coal by populous countries like China and India will blunt global emissions reductions while Western countries saddle themselves with the high costs of an energy transition. China is by far the worlds leading emitter more than doubling American emissions while India is the worlds thirdlargest source and emits more than all 27 countries in the European Union put together according to the World Resources Institute.

The partys education platform mentions the importance of climate literacy for American K12 students several times emphasizing the purported need for students to be able to understand and interpret information relating to climate change. Meanwhile the average reading score for both fourth and eighth grade students in 2022 had fallen by three points relative to 2019 according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress NAEP. We will equip students with the knowledge and skills to understand complex scientific issues counter the rising tide of denialism by promoting environmental and climate literacy and reverse the Trump Administrations cuts to the National Environmental Education Act the platform states. RELATED Even Democrats Arent Sold On Pushing Gender Ideology In Schools Polls Show Student Test Scores Continue To Plummet Despite Hundreds Of Billions In Pandemic Aid For Educationhttpst.coouLox3xLDN Daily Caller DailyCaller July 24 2024 Less than 50 of all fourth grade students were able to read at or above the standard for proficiency in 2022 with only 17 of black students and 21 of Latino pupils meeting the mark according to the NAEP. The U.S. is seeing staggering numbers of children especially children of color and children from lowincome backgrounds without fundamental literacy skills Allison Socol the vice president of policy practice and research for the Education Trust wrote earlier this year. NAEP data consistently demonstrates that about two in every three American students cannot read proficiently and about 40 of all students are effectively nonreaders according to an analysis published by Scientific American in September 2023. Notably the Democratic platform mentions conventional literacy just once while climate literacy is mentioned on two occasions. The word writing or its cognates do not appear at all in the platform. The emphasis on climate literacy aligns with a broader push by Democrats to make education more climatefriendly even as many American students are struggling in the classroom. For example the BidenHarris administration is spending big to replace existing school bus fleets with electric models in order to bring down emissions and fight climate change. While Vice President Kamala Harris has promoted the program as beneficial for students it could end up lining the pockets of Chinese manufacturers and is potentially susceptible to waste fraud and abuse according to reports by the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Environmental Protection Agencys EPA Office of the Inspector General. In June the Chicago Teachers Union CTU a labor organization that is closely allied with the Democratic Party issued a list of climaterelated demands as a part of their contract negotiations with the city even though educational achievement statistics for the citys schools are lackluster according to the Illinois Policy Institute. CTUs demands included calling for the removal of all lead pipes in school buildings the replacement of windows that do not open and the creation of a climate champion position at each school to organize climaterelated activities. In 2022 Democratic Washington Gov. Jay Inslees Department of Health released a fivepart climate curriculum for students that suggested it may be best for students to rely on emotions rather than rational thinking when engaging with climate changerelated subject matter. Moreover pandemicera school shutdowns a policy pushed widely by Democrats at the time have also resulted in significant learning loss that is continuing to disrupt educational outcomes The New York Times found in March.

Trump made it repeatedly clear on the campaign trail that he is not a fan of that law which was passed on straight partyline votes in both houses of Congress or of the hundreds of billions of dollars in green energy subsidies contained in it. In a statement sent out in a postelection memo Sierra Club President Ben Jealous took on a pessimistic tone saying Donald Trump was a disaster for climate progress during his first term and everything hes said and done since suggests hes eager to do even more damage this time. Given the major role played by the Sierra Club and other climatealarm groups in writing the IRA that is exactly the kind of comments we might expect. But a full repeal of the IRA seems unlikely to succeed even with GOP control of the House and Senate. Republican majorities will be slim and the GOP has never shown an ability to hold all its members together when voting on controversial issues. Thus a more scalpellike approach seems more likely to succeed. I asked Karr Ingham a respected petroleum economist who serves as the president of the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers if he thinks Trump and his administration would seek to repeal the Inflation Reduction act in full. Ingham said I certainly hope so. Specifically Ingham pointed to a need to repeal the methane tax waste emissions charge in the IRA and frankly much of the spending boondoggle that is the IRA should simply be eliminated. Tom Pyle president of D.C.based think tank the Institute for Energy Research said he believes President Trump absolutely should pursue a full repeal of that law. The vast array of subsidies embedded in the Inflation Reduction Act IRA is already destabilizing our electricity grid while the spending further fuels inflation and contributes to soaring government deficits. Pyle further notes that Trump has promised an array of tax cuts for working Americans and families and will need to find budget offsets for those. Pyle believes the IRA offers such an opportunity. Getting rid of subsidies for big corporations in exchange for tax relief on working families is both good policy and good politics he adds. But American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers said his group favors retaining at least some major pieces of the IRA specifically pointing to subsidies for carbon capture and storage CCS and hydrogen development. Well advocate for provisions that we support and well seek repeal of provisions that we think dont line up with continued production in the states of oil and gas Sommers told Politico. This is no surprise given that some of APIs biggest members have already made big bets on both CCS and hydrogen projects. It is also important to remember that since the IRA was signed into law in September 2022 renewable energy companies have invested hundreds of billions of dollars into wind solar and electric vehicles projects and a big portion of those investments are happening in key Republican states and counties. Jason Grumet CEO at the American Clean Power Association said in a statement that Private sector clean energy investment is bringing jobs and economic opportunity to small towns and rural communities across the nation while hundreds of new factories have come online in states that have seen far too many good jobs move overseas. Grumet also pointed to the fact that quite a lot of investment into both wind and solar took place during Trumps first term in office even without the added incentives from the IRA subsidy and tax incentive regimes adding that ACPA and its members are committed to working with the TrumpVance administration and the new Congress to continue this great American success story. There is little question the Trump administration will take a hard look at many of the IRA provisions but political realities combined with the billions already invested based on the continuation of these programs makes a full repeal seem highly unlikely.

Yellen said that in order to achieve the goal of netzero global carbon emissions there would need to be 3 trillion globally in annual financing for the cause which she said is a top priority for the Biden administration according to the speech. In order to contribute to this Yellen vowed to finance green initiatives in developing countries through multilateral development banks and develop clean energy technologies. RELATED Treasury Department To Create New Climate Czar Role Expand Climate Change Efforts The transition will require no less than 3 trillion in new capital from many sources each year between now and 2050 Yellen said during the speech. This can be leveraged to support pathways to sustainable and inclusive growth including for countries that have historically received less investment. WASHINGTON DC JULY 09 U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen testifies during a hearing before the House Committee on Financial Services at Rayburn House Office Building on July 9 2024 on Capitol Hill in Washington DC. Photo by Alex WongGetty Images In 2022 global economies provided a record 116 billion to finance climate initiatives in developing countries which Yellen called the singlegreatest economic opportunity of the 21st century during the speech. Neglecting to address climate change and the loss of nature and biodiversity is not just bad environmental policy Yellen said during the speech. It is bad economic policy. Yellen boasted in her speech about the commitments the Biden administration has put forth toward forwarding these green initiatives to achieve their climate goals. RELATED Kamala Harris CoSponsored A Green New Deal. Now Shes Running For The Oval Office At home we are implementing the Inflation Reduction Act the most significant climate legislation in our nations history Yellen said during the speech. It is driving hundreds of billions of dollars of investments in the clean energy technologies and industries that will propel us toward our climate goals and fuel our economic growth. The Inflation Reduction Act allocated 370 billion to subsidize climate initiatives like electric vehicles and other technologies that are essential to President Joe Bidens green agenda. Climate change is literally an existential threat to our nation and to the world Biden said during a speech addressing climate change in July of 2022. As President Ill use my executive powers to combat climate the climate crisis in the absence of congressional actions notwithstanding their incredible action. RELATED Bidens Signature Climate Law Is Falling Short On Its Goal To Boost American Manufacturing During her speech Yellen advocated for these climate initiatives to be implemented beyond our borders. Our ambitions at home are matched by our ambitions abroad Yellen said during the speech. We know that we can only achieve our climate and economic goals from reducing global emissions to adapting and building resilience from strengthening markets to bolstering supply chains if we also lead efforts far beyond our borders.

The enormous sum represents almost 40 of the climate funds the Bank disbursed during the seven year time period with World Bank data failing to show the recipients and uses of the money the Oxfam investigation found. RELATED Bidens World Bank Head Promises To Spend As Much As We Possibly Can On Climate Change The Bank is quick to brag about its climate finance billions but these numbers are based on what it plans to spend not on what it actually spends once a project gets rolling Kate Donald head of Oxfam Internationals Washington D.C. Office said in the release. This is like asking your doctor to assess your diet only by looking at your grocery list without ever checking what actually ends up in your fridge. CARDIFF WALES JULY 11 A closeup of an Oxfam store sign on July 11 2023 in Cardiff Wales. Photo by Matthew HorwoodGetty Images The auditors were unable to determine whether the climate cash was spent on climaterelated initiatives intended to help low and middleincome countries protect people from the impacts of the climate crisis and invest in clean energy according to Oxfam. The World Bank is the largest provider of environmental funding of all multinational financial institutions Oxfam reported and plans to allocate 45 of its annual financing to green initiatives between July 1 2024 and June 20 2025. The U.S. is the largest shareholder in the Bank holding over 15 of its voting shares as of May 31. Climate finance is scarce and yes we know its hard to deliver. But not tracking how or where the money actually gets spent Thats not just some bureaucratic oversight its a fundamental breach of trust that risks derailing the progress we need to make at COP this year Donald said in the release. The World Banks poor recordkeeping practices made performing the audit painstaking and difficult Oxfam reported. We had to sift through layers of complex and incomplete reports and even then the data was full of gaps and inconsistencies Donald said in the release. The fact that this information is so hard to access and understand is alarming it shouldnt take a team of professional researchers to figure out how billions of dollars meant for climate action are being spent.

In doing so I referred to quotes made recently in a Politico interview by Harris recently hired climate engagement director Camila Thorndike. On Monday Thorndike attempted to clarify her remarks in that interview in which she said Harris has just said that they wouldnt ban fracking and the fact that anyone could look up is that the IRA required leases and that was not something that she promoted. Apparently realizing that final phrase had only expanded the confusion among readers and voters which Harris own comments on the subject had already caused Thorndike attempted to clear the air in a post on her X account on Monday. There Thorndike wrote I didnt explain myself clearly here. Contrary to Trumps claims the VP has not banned fracking doesnt support banning fracking and in fact cast the tiebreaking vote on the biggest proclimate law ever which yes opened new fracking leases. People know thats her position. RELATED DAVID BLACKMON Which Kamala Harris Should Voters Believe But as I wrote on Saturday people really dont know what Harriss position truly is mainly because the candidate herself sticks religiously to an apparently memorized script that fails to offer real details that might provide assurance that her sudden 180degree turn on the fracking issue is more than a sortof promise to be broken if she were to assume office next January. A lot of the skepticism about Harris very specific promise that she will not ban fracking stems from the fact that she typically follows up with another memorized phrase that my principles havent changed. Those of us with even modestly long memories know that prior to being handed the Democrat nomination in late July the only principled statement Harris had ever articulated about her personal position on fracking was There is no question I am in favor of banning fracking. Now that is a statement of personal principle made during her 2019 town hall on CNN. It is clear. It is unambiguous. There is no wiggle room in it. If you watch the video of it which can easily be found out on YouTube you will see it is stated with great personal feeling. By contrast today Harris offers a vague assurance saying only she would not ban fracking if elected president. But a ban is a very specific thing it means a rule or executive order halting this safe wellregulated 77yearold industrial process immediately and entirely. None of the mostly friendly and accommodating interviewers who have questioned Harris to this point have bothered to ask her for more information for some real insight into how she suddenly got oil and gas religion on this particular issue for example. Even better would be a question asking her to comment on whether she would seek to de facto ban the process through heavy regulation or support for some of the various lawfare campaigns currently being mounted against the industry by big antidevelopment law firms. Not even Fox News Bret Baier one of only two Harris interviewers who bothered to ask a few hard questions of her sought to flesh out more details on the matter. The result is a public that remains highly skeptical of Harris on this and so many other issues. So to be fair to Thorndike her clarification is noted and taken in the spirit in which it was offered at least by this writer. At the same time though I wish her the best of luck in her ongoing efforts to support and clarify the positions of a candidate who offers so little in the way of detail and whose clear expressions of political principle in the recent past stand in such stark contrast to the promises she is sortof making today. It cant be an easy task. David Blackmon is an energy writer and consultant based in Texas. He spent 40 years in the oil and gas business where he specialized in public policy and communications.

We dont always notice it but much of Earths surface is in constant motion. Scientists have used satellites and groundbased instruments to track land movement associated with volcanoes earthquakes landslides and other phenomena. But a new satellite from NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation ISRO aims to improve what we know and potentially help us prepare for and recover from natural and humancaused disasters. The NISAR NASAISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar mission will measure the motion of nearly all of the planets land and icecovered surfaces twice every 12 days. The pace of NISARs data collection will give researchers a fuller picture of how Earths surface changes over time. This kind of regular observation allows us to look at how Earths surface moves across nearly the entire planet said Cathleen Jones NISAR applications lead at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Together with complementary measurements from other satellites and instruments NISARs data will provide a more complete picture of how Earths surface moves horizontally and vertically. The information will be crucial to better understanding everything from the mechanics of Earths crust to which parts of the world are prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. It could even help resolve whether sections of a levee are damaged or if a hillside is starting to move in a landslide. Targeting an early 2025 launch from India the mission will be able to detect surface motions down to fractions of an inch. In addition to monitoring changes to Earths surface the satellite will be able to track the motion of ice sheets glaciers and sea ice and map changes to vegetation. The source of that remarkable detail is a pair of radar instruments that operate at long wavelengths an Lband system built by JPL and an Sband system built by ISRO. The NISAR satellite is the first to carry both. Each instrument can collect measurements day and night and see through clouds that can obstruct the view of optical instruments. The Lband instrument will also be able to penetrate dense vegetation to measure ground motion. This capability will be especially useful in areas surrounding volcanoes or faults that are obscured by vegetation. The NISAR satellite wont tell us when earthquakes will happen. Instead it will help us better understand which areas of the world are most susceptible to significant earthquakes said Mark Simons the U.S. solid Earth science lead for the mission at Caltech in Pasadena California. Data from the satellite will give researchers insight into which parts of a fault slowly move without producing earthquakes and which sections are locked together and might suddenly slip. In relatively wellmonitored areas like California researchers can use NISAR to focus on specific regions that could produce an earthquake. But in parts of the world that arent as well monitored NISAR measurements could reveal new earthquakeprone areas. And when earthquakes do occur data from the satellite will help researchers understand what happened on the faults that ruptured. From the ISRO perspective we are particularly interested in the Himalayan plate boundary said Sreejith K M the ISRO solid Earth science lead for NISAR at the Space Applications Center in Ahmedabad India. The area has produced great magnitude earthquakes in the past and NISAR will give us unprecedented information on the seismic hazards of the Himalaya. Surface motion is also important for volcano researchers who need data collected regularly over time to detect land movements that may be precursors to an eruption. As magma shifts below Earths surface the land can bulge or sink. The NISAR satellite will help provide a fuller picture for why a volcano deforms and whether that movement signals an eruption. When it comes to infrastructure such as levees aqueducts and dams NISARs ability to provide continuous measurements over years will help to establish the usual state of the structures and surrounding land. Then if something changes resource managers may be able to pinpoint specific areas to examine. Instead of going out and surveying an entire aqueduct every five years you can target your surveys to problem areas said Jones. The data could be equally valuable for showing that a dam hasnt changed after a disaster like an earthquake. For instance if a large earthquake struck San Francisco liquefaction where loosely packed or waterlogged sediment loses its stability after severe ground shaking could pose a problem for dams and levees along the SacramentoSan Joaquin River Delta. Theres over a thousand miles of levees said Jones. Youd need an army to go out and look at them all. The NISAR mission would help authorities survey them from space and identify damaged areas. Then you can save your time and only go out to inspect areas that have changed. That could save a lot of money on repairs after a disaster. The NISAR mission is an equal collaboration between NASA and ISRO and marks the first time the two agencies have cooperated on hardware development for an Earthobserving mission. Managed for the agency by Caltech JPL leads the U.S. component of the project and is providing the missions Lband SAR. NASA is also providing the radar reflector antenna the deployable boom a highrate communication subsystem for science data GPS receivers a solidstate recorder and payload data subsystem. The U R Rao Satellite Centre in Bengaluru India which leads the ISRO component of the mission is providing the spacecraft bus the launch vehicle and associated launch services and satellite mission operations. The ISRO Space Applications Centre in Ahmedabad is providing the Sband SAR electronics. To learn more about NISAR visit httpsnisar.jpl.nasa.gov Jane J.

At the same time NASAs Atmospheric Waves Experiment or AWE recorded enormous swells in the atmosphere that the hurricane produced roughly 55 miles above the ground. Such information helps us better understand how terrestrial weather can affect space weather part of the research NASA does to understand how our space environment can disrupt satellites communication signals and other technology. These massive ripples through the upper atmosphere known as atmospheric gravity waves appear in AWEs images as concentric bands artificially colored here in red yellow and blue extending away from northern Florida. Like rings of water spreading from a drop in a pond circular waves from Helene are seen billowing westward from Floridas northwest coast said Ludger Scherliess who is the AWE principal investigator at Utah State University in Logan. Launched in November 2023 and mounted on the outside of the International Space Station the AWE instrument looks down at Earth scanning for atmospheric gravity waves ripplelike patterns in the air generated by atmospheric disturbances such as violent thunderstorms tornadoes tsunamis wind bursts over mountain ranges and hurricanes. It does this by looking for brightness fluctuations in colorful bands of light called airglow in Earths mesosphere. AWEs study of these gravity waves created by terrestrial weather helps NASA pinpoint how they affect space weather. These views of gravity waves from Hurricane Helene are among the first publicly released images from AWE confirming that the instrument has the sensitivity to reveal the impacts hurricanes have on Earths upper atmosphere.

BHS is a summer school program for migrant children whose families work in Washington County Maine during the wild blueberry harvest season. The program is hosted by Mano en Mano in Milbridge Maine. This summer University of Maine 4H part of the NASA Science Activation Programs Learning Ecosystems Northeast team was invited to deliver enrichment programs during the school day alongside a seasoned BHS employee an educator from the Mikmaq community in what is now known as Nova Scotia. The goal of BHS is to meet the needs of youth by providing culturally responsive projectbased learning while preventing summer learning loss and compensating for school disruptions among students Mano en Mano. Migrant families come to Downeast from Mikmaq First Nation communities in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick southern states and from within Maine including Passamoquoddy communities in eastern Washington County and a Latino community in the western part of the county. Families stay to harvest blueberries anywhere from two to five weeks. With support from 4H educators youth surveyed the schoolyard for pollinators investigated the parts of pollinators and flowers and learned why blueberries are an important part of Wabanaki culture. BHS really becomes a home for the children while they are here. I think one of the reasons is because they are encouraged to be proud of their identity and who they are they get to be their authentic selves. Its a neat space where teachers and youth are speaking Mikmaq Passamaquoddy Spanish and English while supporting each other and learning and experiencing new things. Gabrielle Brodek 4H Professional After completing my second year helping at Blueberry Harvest School I loved seeing the returning faces of the kids who have been coming year after year the kids remember you and hug you and are sad when the season is over and BHS ends.

The seeds planted over those years have ripened into improved environmental conservation communitybased natural resource management and new remote sensing tools. Known for its governing philosophy of gross national happiness Bhutan has a constitutional mandate to maintain at least 60 forest cover. The governments goals include achieving nationwide food security by 2030. Bhutan first approached the U.S. State Department to partner on science technology engineering and mathematics STEM opportunities for the country and NASA was invited to help lead these opportunities. In 2019 Bhutans King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck visited NASAs Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley California and was introduced to several NASA programs. NASAs Earth scientists and research staff from several complementary programs have helped support Bhutans goals by providing data resources and training to make satellite data more useful to communities and decision makers. Bhutan now uses NASA satellite data in its national land management decisions and plans to foster more geospatial jobs to help address environmental issues. Bhutans National Land Commission offers tax breaks to farmers to support food security and economic resilience. However finding and reaching eligible farmers on the ground can be expensive and time consuming which means small farmers in remote areas can be missed. A team from SERVIR a joint NASAU.S. Agency for International Development initiative worked with Bhutanese experts to create decisionmaking tools like the Farm Action Toolkit FAcT. The tool uses imagery from the NASAU.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellites to identify and measure the countrys farmland. SERVIR researchers met with agricultural organizations including Bhutans Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock National Statistics Bureau and National Center for Organic Agriculture to adjust the tool for the countrys unique geography and farming practices. The Land Commission now uses FAcT to identify small farms and bring support to more of the country. NASA also develops local capacity to use Earth data through efforts like the Applied Remote Sensing Training Program ARSET. In early 2024 ARSET staff worked with SERVIR and Druk Holdings and Investments DHI to host a workshop with 46 Bhutanese government personnel. Using tailored local case studies the teams worked to find ways to better manage natural resources assist land use planning and monitor disasters. We look forward to continuing this collaboration as there are still many areas where NASAs expertise can significantly impact Bhutans development goals said Manish Rai an analyst with DHI who helped coordinate the workshop. This collaboration is a twoway street. While Bhutan has benefited greatly from NASAs support we believe there are also unique insights and experiences that Bhutan can share with NASA particularly in areas like environmental conservation and communitybased natural resource management. By working with students and educators from primary schools to the university level Bhutan and NASA have been investing in the countrys future environmental leadership. Supporting educators and training trainers have been pillars of this collaboration. NASA and Bhutan have worked together to boost the skills of earlycareer Earth scientists. For example NASAs DEVELOP program for undergraduates worked directly with local institutions to create several applied science internships for Bhutanese students studying in the U.S. Tenzin Wangmo a high school biology teacher in Bhutan participated in DEVELOP projects focusing on agriculture and water resources. According to Wangmo the lessons learned from those projects have been helpful in connecting with her students about STEM opportunities and environmental issues. Most people only think of NASA as going to space rather than Earth science she said. It was encouraging to my students that there are lots of opportunities for you if you try. NASA is also supporting Bhutans future environmental leadership through the GLOBE Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program. The GLOBE program is a U.S. interagency outreach program that works with teachers to support STEM literacy through handson environmental learning. Since 2021 GLOBE has worked through the U.S. State Department and organizations like the Ugyen Wangchuck Institute for Forest Research and Training to support educators at two dozen schools in Bhutan. The program reached more than 650 students with activities like estimating their schools carbon footprint. This focus on STEM education enables students and professionals to contribute to Bhutans specific development goals now and in the future. Sonam Tshering a student who completed two DEVELOP projects on Bhutanese agriculture while studying at the University of Texas at El Paso was able to share the value of these efforts at the 2023 United Nations Climate Conference. By applying satellite data from NASA we aimed to create actionable insights for our local farmers and our policymakers back in Bhutan she said.

Data from space shows water tilting up toward the north side of the Dickson Fjord as it sloshed from south to north and back every 90 seconds for nine days after a 2023 rockslide. The international Surface Water and Ocean Topography SWOT satellite mission a collaboration between NASA and Frances CNES Centre National dtudes Spatiales detected the unique contours of a tsunami that sloshed within the steep walls of a fjord in Greenland in September 2023. Triggered by a massive rockslide the tsunami generated a seismic rumble that reverberated around the world for nine days. An international research team that included seismologists geophysicists and oceanographers recently reported on the event after a year of analyzing data. The SWOT satellite collected water elevation measurements in Dickson Fjord on Sept. 17 2023 the day after the initial rockslide and tsunami. The data was compared with measurements made under normal conditions a few weeks prior on Aug. 6 2023. In the data visualization above colors toward the lighter end of the scale indicate higher water levels and darker colors indicate lowerthannormal levels. The data suggests that water levels at some points along the north side of the fjord were as much as 4 feet 1.2 meters higher than on the south. SWOT happened to fly over at a time when the water had piled up pretty high against the north wall of the fjord said Josh Willis a sea level researcher at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Seeing the shape of the wave thats something we could never do before SWOT. In a paper published recently in Science researchers traced a seismic signal back to a tsunami that began when more than 880 million cubic feet of rock and ice 25 million cubic meters fell into Dickson Fjord. Part of a network of channels on Greenlands eastern coast the fjord is about 1772 feet 540 meters deep and 1.7 miles 2.7 kilometers wide with walls taller than 6000 feet 1830 meters. Far from the open ocean in a confined space the energy of the tsunamis motion had limited opportunity to dissipate so the wave moved back and forth about every 90 seconds for nine days. It caused tremors recorded on seismic instruments thousands of miles away. From about 560 miles 900 kilometers above SWOT uses its sophisticated Kaband Radar Interferometer KaRIn instrument to measure the height of nearly all water on Earths surface including the ocean and freshwater lakes reservoirs and rivers. This observation also shows SWOTs ability to monitor hazards potentially helping in disaster preparedness and risk reduction said SWOT program scientist Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer at NASA Headquarters in Washington. It can also see into fjords as it turns out. The KaRIn radars resolution was fine enough to make observations between the relatively narrow walls of the fjord said LeeLueng Fu the SWOT project scientist. The footprint of the conventional altimeters used to measure ocean height is too large to resolve such a small body of water. Launched in December 2022 from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California SWOT is now in its operations phase collecting data that will be used for research and other purposes. The SWOT satellite was jointly developed by NASA and CNES with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency CSA and the UK Space Agency. NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory managed for the agency by Caltech in Pasadena California leads the U.S. component of the project. For the flight system payload NASA provided the KaRIn instrument a GPS science receiver a laser retroreflector a twobeam microwave radiometer and NASA instrument operations. CNES provided the Doppler Orbitography and Radioposition Integrated by Satellite DORIS system the dual frequency Poseidon altimeter developed by Thales Alenia Space the KaRIn radiofrequency subsystem together with Thales Alenia Space and with support from the UK Space Agency the satellite platform and ground operations.

Scientists with NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA project the ozone layer could fully recover by 2066. During the peak of ozone depletion season from Sept. 7 through Oct. 13 the 2024 area of the ozone hole ranked the seventh smallest since recovery began in 1992 when the Montreal Protocol a landmark international agreement to phase out ozonedepleting chemicals began to take effect. At almost 8 million square miles 20 million square kilometers the monthly average ozonedepleted region in the Antarctic this year was nearly three times the size of the contiguous U.S. The hole reached its greatest oneday extent for the year on Sept. 28 at 8.5 million square miles 22.4 million square kilometers. The improvement is due to a combination of continuing declines in harmful chlorofluorocarbon CFC chemicals along with an unexpected infusion of ozone carried by air currents from north of the Antarctic scientists said. In previous years NASA and NOAA have reported the ozone hole ranking using a time frame dating back to 1979 when scientists began tracking Antarctic ozone levels with satellite data. Using that longer record this years hole ranked 20th smallest in area across the 45 years of observations. The 2024 Antarctic hole is smaller than ozone holes seen in the early 2000s said Paul Newman leader of NASAs ozone research team and chief scientist for Earth sciences at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland. The gradual improvement weve seen in the past two decades shows that international efforts that curbed ozonedestroying chemicals are working. The ozonerich layer high in the atmosphere acts as a planetary sunscreen that helps shield us from harmful ultraviolet UV radiation from the Sun. Areas with depleted ozone allow more UV radiation resulting in increased cases of skin cancer and cataracts. Excessive exposure to UV light can also reduce agricultural yields as well as damage aquatic plants and animals in vital ecosystems. Scientists were alarmed in the 1970s at the prospect that CFCs could eat away at atmospheric ozone. By the mid1980s the ozone layer had been depleted so much that a broad swath of the Antarctic stratosphere was essentially devoid of ozone by early October each year. Sources of damaging CFCs included coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners as well as aerosols in hairspray antiperspirant and spray paint. Harmful chemicals were also released in the manufacture of insulating foams and as components of industrial fire suppression systems. The Montreal Protocol was signed in 1987 to phase out CFCbased products and processes. Countries worldwide agreed to replace the chemicals with more environmentally friendly alternatives by 2010. The release of CFC compounds has dramatically decreased following the Montreal Protocol. But CFCs already in the air will take many decades to break down. As existing CFC levels gradually decline ozone in the upper atmosphere will rebound globally and ozone holes will shrink. For 2024 we can see that the ozone holes severity is below average compared to other years in the past three decades but the ozone layer is still far from being fully healed said Stephen Montzka senior scientist of the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory. Researchers rely on a combination of systems to monitor the ozone layer. They include instruments on NASAs Aura satellite the NOAA20 and NOAA21 satellites and the Suomi National Polarorbiting Partnership satellite jointly operated by NASA and NOAA. NOAA scientists also release instrumented weather balloons from the South Pole Baseline Atmospheric Observatory to observe ozone concentrations directly overhead in a measurement called Dobson Units. The 2024 concentration reached its lowest value of 109 Dobson Units on October 5. The lowest value ever recorded over the South Pole was 92 Dobson Units in October 2006. NASA and NOAA satellite observations of ozone concentrations cover the entire ozone hole which can produce a slightly smaller value for the lowest Dobson Unit measurement. That is well below the 225 Dobson Units that was typical of the ozone cover above the Antarctic in 1979 said NOAA research chemist Bryan Johnson. So theres still a long way to go before atmospheric ozone is back to the levels before the advent of widespread CFC pollution.

New research paints a picture of a landscape in change. A new study coauthored by NASA scientists details where and how greenhouse gases are escaping from the Earths vast northern permafrost region as the Arctic warms. The frozen soils encircling the Arctic from Alaska to Canada to Siberia store twice as much carbon as currently resides in the atmosphere hundreds of billions of tons and most of it has been buried for centuries. An international team led by researchers at Stockholm University found that from 2000 to 2020 carbon dioxide uptake by the land was largely offset by emissions from it. Overall they concluded that the region has been a net contributor to global warming in recent decades in large part because of another greenhouse gas methane that is shorterlived but traps significantly more heat per molecule than carbon dioxide. To view this video please enable JavaScript and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The findings reveal a landscape in flux said Abhishek Chatterjee a coauthor and scientist at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. We know that the permafrost region has captured and stored carbon for tens of thousands of years he said. But what we are finding now is that climatedriven changes are tipping the balance toward permafrost being a net source of greenhouse gas emissions. Permafrost is ground that has been permanently frozen for anywhere from two years to hundreds of thousands of years. A core of it reveals thick layers of icy soils enriched with dead plant and animal matter that can be dated using radiocarbon and other techniques. When permafrost thaws and decomposes microbes feed on this organic carbon releasing some of it as greenhouse gases. Unlocking a fraction of the carbon stored in permafrost could further fuel climate change. Temperatures in the Arctic are already warming two to four times faster than the global average and scientists are learning how thawing permafrost is shifting the region from being a net sink for greenhouse gases to becoming a net source of warming. Theyve tracked emissions using groundbased instruments aircraft and satellites. One such campaign NASAs ArcticBoreal Vulnerability Experiment ABoVE is focused on Alaska and western Canada. Yet locating and measuring emissions across the far northern fringes of Earth remains challenging. One obstacle is the vast scale and diversity of the environment composed of evergreen forests sprawling tundra and waterways. The new study was undertaken as part of the Global Carbon Projects RECCAP2 effort which brings together different science teams tools and datasets to assess regional carbon balances every few years. The authors followed the trail of three greenhouse gases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide across 7 million square miles 18 million square kilometers of permafrost terrain from 2000 to 2020. Researchers found the region especially the forests took up a fraction more carbon dioxide than it released. This uptake was largely offset by carbon dioxide emitted from lakes and rivers as well as from fires that burned both forest and tundra. They also found that the regions lakes and wetlands were strong sources of methane during those two decades. Their waterlogged soils are low in oxygen while containing large volumes of dead vegetation and animal matter ripe conditions for hungry microbes. Compared to carbon dioxide methane can drive significant climate warming in short timescales before breaking down relatively quickly. Methanes lifespan in the atmosphere is about 10 years whereas carbon dioxide can last hundreds of years. The findings suggest the net change in greenhouse gases helped warm the planet over the 20year period. But over a 100year period emissions and absorptions would mostly cancel each other out. In other words the region teeters from carbon source to weak sink. The authors noted that events such as extreme wildfires and heat waves are major sources of uncertainty when projecting into the future. The scientists used two main strategies to tally greenhouse gas emissions from the region. Bottomup methods estimate emissions from ground and airbased measurements and ecosystem models. Topdown methods use atmospheric measurements taken directly from satellite sensors including those on NASAs Orbiting Carbon Observatory2 OCO2 and JAXAs Japan Aerospace Exploration AgencyGreenhouse Gases Observing Satellite. Regarding nearterm 20year global warming potential both scientific approaches aligned on the big picture but differed in magnitude The bottomup calculations indicated significantly more warming. This study is one of the first where we are able to integrate different methods and datasets to put together this very comprehensive greenhouse gas budget into one report Chatterjee said. It reveals a very complex picture. Jane J.

Melted snow washes from snowy peaks into the rivers reservoirs and streams that supply millions of Americans with freshwateras much as 75 of the annual freshwater supply for some states. But as climate change brings winter temperatures to new highs these summer rushes of freshwater can sometimes slow to a trickle. The runoff supports cities most people wouldnt expect explained Chris Derksen a glaciologist and Research Scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada. Big cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles get water from snowmelt. To forecast snowmelt with greater accuracy NASAs Earth Science Technology Office ESTO and a team of researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst are developing SNOWWI a dualfrequency synthetic aperture radar that could one day be the cornerstone of future missions dedicated to measuring snow mass on a global scale something the science community lacks. SNOWWI aims to fill this technology gap. In January and March 2024 the SNOWWI research team passed a key milestone flying their prototype for the first time aboard a small twinengine aircraft in Grand Mesa Colorado and gathering useful data on the areas winter snowfields. Id say the big development is that weve gone from pieces of hardware in a lab to something that makes meaningful data explained Paul Siqueira professor of engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and principal investigator for SNOWWI. SNOWWI stands for Snow Waterequivalent Wide Swath Interferometer and Scatterometer. The instrument probes snowpack with two Kuband radar signals a highfrequency signal that interacts with individual snow grains and a lowfrequency signal that passes through the snowpack to the ground. The highfrequency signal gives researchers a clear look at the consistency of the snowpack while the lowfrequency signal helps researchers determine its total depth. Having two frequencies allows us to better separate the influence of the snow microstructure from the influence of the snow depth said Derksen who participated in the Grand Mesa field campaign. One frequency is good two frequencies are better. The SNOWWI team in Grand Mesa preparing to flight test their instrument. From an altitude of 4 kilometers 2.5 miles SNOWWI can map 100 square kilometers about 38 square miles in just 30 minutes. As both of those scattered signals interact with the snowpack and bounce back towards the instrument they lose energy. SNOWWI measures that lost energy and researchers later correlate those losses to features within the snowpack especially its depth density and mass. From an airborne platform with an altitude of 2.5 miles 4 kilometers SNOWWI could map 40 square miles 100 square kilometers of snowy terrain in just 30 minutes. From space SNOWWIs coverage would be even greater. Siqueira is working with Capella Space to develop a spaceready SNOWWI for satellite missions. But theres still much work to be done before SNOWWI visits space. Siqueira plans to lead another field campaign this time in the mountains of Idaho. Grand Mesa is relatively flat and Siqueira wants to see how well SNOWWI can measure snowpack tucked in the folds of complex asymmetrical terrain. For Derksen who spends much of his time quantifying the freshwater content of snowpack in Canada having a reliable database of global snowpack measurements would be gamechanging. Snowmelt is money. It has intrinsic economic value he said. If you want your salmon to run in mountain streams in the spring you must have snowmelt. But unlike other natural resources at this time we really cant monitor it very well.

Using data from an instrument designed by NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California the nonprofit Carbon Mapper has released the first methane and carbon dioxide detections from the Tanager1 satellite. The detections highlight methane plumes in Pakistan and Texas as well as a carbon dioxide plume in South Africa. The data contributes to Carbon Mappers goal to identify and measure greenhouse gas pointsource emissions on a global scale and make that information accessible and actionable. Enabled by Carbon Mapper and built by Planet Labs PBC Tanager1 launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Aug. 16 and has been collecting data to verify that its imaging spectrometer which is based on technology developed at NASA JPL is functioning properly. Both Planet Labs PBC and JPL are members of the philanthropically funded Carbon Mapper Coalition. The first greenhouse gas images from Tanager1 are exciting and are a compelling sign of things to come said James Graf director for Earth Science and Technology at JPL. The satellite plays a crucial role in detecting and measuring methane and carbon dioxide emissions. The mission is a giant step forward in addressing greenhouse gas emissions. The data used to produce the Pakistan image was collected over the city of Karachi on Sept. 19 and shows a roughly 2.5milelong 4kilometerlong methane plume emanating from a landfill. Carbon Mappers preliminary estimate of the source emissions rate is more than 2600 pounds 1200 kilograms of methane released per hour. The image collected that same day over Kendal South Africa displays a nearly 2milelong 3kilometerlong carbon dioxide plume coming from a coalfired power plant. Carbon Mappers preliminary estimate of the source emissions rate is roughly 1.3 million pounds 600000 kilograms of carbon dioxide per hour. The Texas image collected on Sept. 24 reveals a methane plume to the south of the city of Midland in the Permian Basin one of the largest oilfields in the world. Carbon Mappers preliminary estimate of the source emissions rate is nearly 900 pounds 400 kilograms of methane per hour. In the 1980s JPL helped pioneer the development of imaging spectrometers with AVIRIS Airborne VisibleInfrared Imaging Spectrometer and in 2022 NASA installed the imaging spectrometer EMIT Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation developed at JPL aboard the International Space Station. A descendant of those instruments the imaging spectrometer aboard Tanager1 can measure hundreds of wavelengths of light reflected from Earths surface. Each chemical compound on the ground and in the atmosphere reflects and absorbs different combinations of wavelengths which give it a spectral fingerprint that researchers can identify. Using this approach Tanager1 will help researchers detect and measure emissions down to the facility level. Once in full operation the spacecraft will scan about 116000 square miles 300000 square kilometers of Earths surface per day. Methane and carbon dioxide measurements collected by Tanager1 will be publicly available on the Carbon Mapper data portal. Carbon Mapper is a nonprofit organization focused on facilitating timely action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Its mission is to fill gaps in the emerging global ecosystem of methane and carbon dioxide monitoring systems by delivering data at facility scale that is precise timely and accessible to empower sciencebased decision making and action. The organization is leading the development of the Carbon Mapper constellation of satellites supported by a publicprivate partnership composed of Planet Labs PBC JPL the California Air Resources Board Arizona State University and RMI with funding from High Tide Foundation Bloomberg Philanthropies Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment and other philanthropic donors.
