FIRST ON FOX Environmental groups that have been vocal about climate change were silent when asked about Vice President Kamala Harris campaign dropping nearly 7 million on private jet flights since July. Harris spent nearly 4 million on private flights in just six weeks starting in July, after calling on Americans to change their habits to curb climate change, a previous Fox News Digital review found.The latest review of new filings with the Federal Election Commission reveals that Harris spent an additional 3.1 million on private planes in September alone. Fox News Digital asked environmental groups, several which have protested private jet use, about Harris private flights but did not receive a response from any of them. The groups included Sunrise Movement, the Center for Biological Diversity, Greenpeace, Earth Island Institute, Earth Justice, Naturefriends International, and International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Thats practical. The 2024 presidential campaign is not the first time Harris has used private jets to hit the campaign trail.

Vice President Kamala Harris is facing criticism for touting oil production under the Biden administration after becoming the Democratic nominee, while previously calling for such companies to pay the price for climate change. During her 2019 presidential bid, Harris told voters that she was in favor of the Department of Justice investigating oil companies, such as Chevron and Shell, for profiting off pollution. These big oil companies, these fossil fuel companies, look, you should be really prepared to look at a serious fine or be charged with a crime. Because heres the thing, these big oil companies and these fossil fuel companies have been making so much money and profiting off of this pollution, Harris said. Yet, after becoming the Democratic nominee, the vice president began touting the largest increase in domestic oil production in history under the BidenHarris administration.

In 2024, voters in multiple states will decide on key ballot initiatives that will shape their climate and environmental policies for the next several years. Washington residents face a particularly important decision on whether to repeal the states major climate policy, the Climate Commitment Act, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 95 below 1990 levels by 2050.The measure, dubbed Washington Initiative 2117, would repeal the 2021 law and prohibit state agencies from implementing any carbon capandtrade system. Proponents of the bill have heavily criticized the law and claim the current carbon tax has increased energy costs. HARRIS DROPS MILLIONS ON PRIVATE JET SPENDING DESPITE CALLING CLIMATE CHANGE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT A woman drops off her ballot ahead of the primary election, on March 4, 2024, at the Los Angeles County Registrar in Norwalk, California. Frederic J. BrownGetty Images Lets Go Washington, a political action committee PAC endorsing the measure, suggested that if the bill passes, voters will save on gas, groceries and on energy bills.We are urging all Washington residents to vote yes, pay less on 2117 to finally hold Gov. Jay Inslees administration accountable for their arrogant and reckless policymaking, Brian Heywood, Lets Go Washington founder, told Fox News Digital in a statement. The Climate Commitment Act is a deeply flawed and broken program thats taken billions of dollars off the backs of everyday Washingtonians while doing nothing to reduce carbon emissions. A group opposing the bill, however, tells Fox News Digital that passing the measure would mean more pollution in our air and water.LAWSUIT ACCUSES STATE DEPARTMENT, DOJ OF STONEWALLING FOIA REQUESTS REGARDING CLIMATE OFFICE PERSONNEL I2117 is a deceptive initiative opposed by more than 500 organizations across Washington, including small businesses and major employers, firefighters, doctors and nurses, the majority of federally recognized Tribal Nations in Washington state, because it would threaten our health and devastate investments in transportation, said Kelsey Nyland, a spokesperson for the No 2117, a coalition campaigning against the measure. By forcing 5.4 billion in cuts to our states transportation funding, it would hurt every corner of our state, putting major road and bridge projects addressing congestion, safety and freight mobility at risk of being delayed or even canceled. Wind and solar panels merge in a desert alternative energy site in Mojave, California. Joe SohmGetty Images California voters will also see a climate initiative on their ballots this fall. If passed, Proposition 4 would create a 10 billion taxpayerfunded bond to finance climate projects in the state. Some of these include improving drinking water across the state, wildfire prevention efforts, and protecting coastal areas from sea level rise.Opponents of the ballot measure call it too pricey, suggesting that there would be financial implications to passing it. Prop 4 is a Democrat political wishlist disguised as socalled climate action, saddling taxpayers with nearly 20 billion in Wall Street debt. Rather than funding lasting infrastructure, it funnels money into pet projects like popup tents for farmers markets and zoo exhibits  far from the meaningful solutions Californians need, Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones told Fox News Digital in a statement. Dont be fooled by claims of progress Prop 4 wont address any of the major issues facing our state, but will leave taxpayers bearing the cost of yet another massive loan.The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association HJTA also said the state should not take a loanbased approach to climaterelated mitigation.

Bob Riha Jr.Getty ImagesClean water and fire mitigation are important priorities that should be funded in the budget, first, not last. Proposition 4 instead borrows 10 billion, which has to be repaid with interest. This is the most expensive way to pay for anything. Prop. 4 also funds billions of dollars of vague grants and programs, and these should never be paid for with borrowed money, a spokesperson for HJTA told Fox. Other states will vote on environmental initiatives this cycle. Question 4 on Rhode Islands ballot will decide on a 53million bond for land preservation in the state, while Amendment 1 in Minnesota seeks to earmark funds from the state lottery to the Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund ENRTF for environmental projects.

About 54 of land in the 48 contiguous US states is affected by droughts.Even as the country experiences autumn and heads further away from a summer of record heat, the droughts continue to rise. More than 150 million people in the country  and 149.8 million in the 48 contiguous states  are in a drought this week. That is about a 34 increase since last week and an over 150 increase since last month.The drought is also affecting more than 318m acres of crops, a 57 increase since last month, according to the tracker.That reality is only the latest illustration of global warming and the climate crisis, spurred primarily by humans burning of fossil fuels.Weather tracker Zero rain and unseasonable heat cause flash droughts in USRead moreLast month, it was reported that worlds water cycle was out of balance for the first time in human history. Nearly 3 billion people face water scarcity.Drought conditions are not simply caused by a decrease in rain  but are driven and exacerbated by abnormally high temperatures that can quickly suck moisture from the atmosphere and the earth.The problem, however, is more complicated than simply counting rainy days. Droughts can occur even when there is slightly more rain than usual, depending on the frequency of rainfall. If there is a lot of rain all at once, its difficult for the water to be properly absorbed into the ground.Climate change can cause extremes in both directions, Dr Lifeng Luo, a professor of environmental science at Michigan State University, said. When it rains really hard, its not going to really penetrate into the soil. It becomes runoff, which produces floods.Different city and state leaders across the US have acknowledged the drought issue and have tried various ways of beginning to address it. In New York City, the mayor, Eric Adams, encouraged residents to water their lawns less frequently and to only flush when necessary.Taking shorter showers means more water could be allocated for other purposes, which is good, Luo said. But its impacts in terms of reversing a drought is very small.According to the National Integrated Drought Information System, droughts will increase an areas reliance on groundwater. Groundwater provides more than 40 of the water used for US agriculture and domestic water supplies. Increased pumping during droughts can reduce the future availability of those supplies.Climate warning as worlds rivers dry up at fastest rate for 30 yearsRead moreCalifornia, which relies heavily on the agricultural industry to support its economy, lost 1.7bn in crop revenue in 2022 due to the ongoing drought.Dry conditions can also result in low water levels on rivers and other waterways. Ports and other waterborne transportation may become limited due to a reduction in available routes and cargocarrying capacity, which increases transportation costs.That cost increase is ultimately transferred to consumers, who see it in the form of higherpriced products, groceries and other commodities.Droughts affect water resources, agriculture, transportation, which can overall impact the economy, Luo said. To have a broad relief, we need regular precipitation, and theres no simple answer to getting that.Explore more on these topicsUS newsDroughtClimate crisisPuerto RicoUS weatherWaternewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionGreen lightNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints  correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms  conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top 2024 Guardian News  Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph Scott OlsonGetty ImagesUS elections 2024Activists fear Florida enshrining right to fish and hunt will lead to trophy huntingCritics say amendment 2 is intentionally open to applying chicanery and outdated hunting practicesRichard Luscombe in MiamiThu 7 Nov 2024 12.34 ESTLast modified on Fri 8 Nov 2024 13.29 ESTShareBlack bears in Florida could soon again be in the crosshairs of trophy hunters after a controversial wildlife ballot measure was approved by voters, environmental advocates say.The fear stems from amendment 2, which enshrines into the state constitution legal protections for citizens right to hunt and fish.The law, critics say, was written deliberately vaguely in order to present it as a conservation measure instead of a vehicle they claim will speed the rolling back of environmental protections and open a pathway to future legislation permitting inhumane measures such as steeljawed traps and hunting with dogs.Bear hunting has been banned in Florida since 1994, except for a limited single season in 2015, and while the amendment does not specifically reintroduce it, activists say it is a significant step on the way.Earlier this year, state legislators passed a law allowing the shooting and killing of black bears in selfdefense, with opponents at the time pointing out it could be abused, especially in rural areas, by landowners simply wanting to eliminate what they saw as nuisance animals.The runup to Tuesdays election saw a cascade of TV commercials and other media attention in Florida dedicated to more prominent ballot measures such as a protection of abortion rights and the legalization of recreational marijuana. Both failed.The approval of amendment 2 is disappointing, as it suggests that many voters may not have been fully informed about the implications of this measure, said Kate MacFall, Florida state director for the Humane Society of the US.Unfortunately, our states constitution now includes language that could lead to attempts to legalize outdated, cruel and harmful practices, such as the trophy hunting of black bears, trapping, snaring and baiting  activities that most Floridians neither participate in nor support.She said the amendment that establishes hunting as the preferred means of wildlife management in Florida ignored the availability of proven, nonlethal conflictprevention measures.Efforts by the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission FWC to pass essential wildlife protections affecting hunting and fishing could also be compromised, she added.Scientists and conservationists warned ahead of election day that the language of the amendment, specifically a vague reference to traditional methods as the preferred form of legalized hunting, could supersede sciencebased wildlife management.That language is open to applying chicanery, David Guest, a retired Earthjustice lawyer based in Florida, told the Guardian.Does that mean that you can use explosives in the destructive practice called blast fishing? I mean, what in the world is this?There is no legal or other definition of traditional methods in the subsequent language of the amendment, Guest said, leaving its interpretation wide open.Opponents say that vagueness could enable worstcase possibilities such as the use of steeljaw leghold traps, which are considered cruel and illegal in more than 100 countries using hounds to hunt bears and other game, which is banned or restricted in several states and more relaxed killing limits.Hot queen conch seeks cool mates Floridas new speed dating service to save endangered shellfishRead moreMeanwhile, a Florida Bar analysis suggested that organized hunts are likely to become more common.The amendment received 67 support, far surpassing the 60 needed. With its passage, Florida became the 24th state, and last in the southeast, to add hunting and fishing as a constitutional right.Conservativeleaning groups such as the National Rifle Association and Congressional Sportsmens Foundation are behind a number of similar sportsmens bills of rights measures across the country. They view hunting as a cultural tradition, and legislation they sponsor is intended to counter proposals to limit hunting and fishing.Despite this discouraging result, the Humane Society of the US will continue to fight to protect Floridas wildlife from these cruel practices at all levels, MacFall said.Explore more on these topicsUS elections 2024FloridaWildlifeConservationUS politicsAnimalsHuntingnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUSUS elections 2024WorldEnvironmentUkraineSoccerBusinessTechScienceNewslettersWellnessNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints  correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms  conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top 2024 Guardian News  Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Cop officials also introduced the fake investor to a senior executive at the national oil and gas company Socar to discuss investment opportunities.What would a good outcome at Cop29 look like?Read moreSoltanov told the fake investment group I would be happy to create a contact between your team and their team Socar so that they can start discussions. Shortly after that they received an email from Socar.The UN framework convention on climate change UNFCCC, the UN body that oversees Cop, says officials should not use their roles to seek private gain and it expects them to act without selfinterest.On the recording, Soltanov tells the fake oil and gas group There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established. Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.He then described natural gas as a transitional fuel, adding We will have a certain amount of oil and natural gas being produced, perhaps for ever. At Cop28 last year, the countries involved agreed to transition away from fossil fuels, and the UN body the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is clear that developing new oil and gas fields is incompatible with climate goals signed up to in the Paris agreement.The Cop29 team also appeared willing to waive climate requirements for the company if it sponsored the event. Cop event sponsors are supposed to commit to cutting their emissions and are expected to sign a national pledge, promising to come up with a credible net zero transition plan at some point over the next two years.However, during the negotiations, these requirements were waived and a new clause was added to give the fake investment group meeting opportunities with key local stakeholders from the energy sector at Cop29.There was a similar scandal at the Cop28 talks last year in the UAE when leaked documents revealed the host planned to use climate meetings with other countries to promote deals for its national oil and gas companies. The talks were chaired by Sultan Al Jaber, the chief executive of the national oil company Adnoc and the UAEs climate envoy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planets most important stories.

They offer highly granular and robust data with excellent geographic and temporal coverage. With the consequences of climate change gradually becoming more apparent, adding the most recent data makes our estimates much more robust.Despite the increase in risk to global economies, some experts say the analysis is a huge understatement of the impact climate breakdown will wreak on economic growth.Sandy Trust, an actuary who works on sustainability and the climate crisis, said the small print in the report by the network of central banks revealed they had failed to take in to account the impact of climate tipping points, sea temperature rises, migration and conflict as a result of global heating, human health impacts or biodiversity loss. Climate tipping points, for example the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, and the deforestation of the Amazon, are critical thresholds that, if crossed, will lead to huge, accelerating and sometimes irreversible changes in the climate system.View image in fullscreenClimate tipping points, for example the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, are critical thresholds that, if crossed, will lead to huge changes in the climate system. Photograph Luis LeamusAlamyTrust said This is a massive onethird hit from physical damage on GDP. It has increased more than five times, from about 6 to 33.But while this is a much more severe damage risk, it is by no means comprehensive. The analogy I would use is a model of the Titanic where you can see the iceberg, but the modelling fails to recognise that there are not enough lifeboats on board, or that the cold water is a threat to human life. So this report is still systemically underestimating the risk.The NGFS is a group of global banks that provide environmental and climate risk modelling in the financial sector. Its update on climate risks using the new methodology foresees more than 30 losses due to the climate crisis by 2100 from a 3C rise in global average surface temperatures. The report said The new damage function does a much better job than its predecessor at representing the physical risks posed by climate change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planets most important stories.

It cannot be excluded that the economic effects of climate change might turn out to be even more severe than visualised under the NGFS scenarios, for instance, if certain tipping points are reached, the report said.Thus, users should also take into account the tail risks of climate change, along with other risks such as naturerelated ones, which are not necessarily captured by these scenarios.Trust wrote a report last year with the University of Exeter, which said widely available climate crisis scenarios systematically underestimated the risks, and he said underestimating the impact of global heating was extremely dangerous.Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyEconomicsEconomic growth GDPUS economic growth and recessionClimate crisisFinancial sectornewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyFrom higher tariffs to lower taxes, will Donald Trumps economic plan pay off?19h agoVon der Leyens Cop29 absence sends fatal signal, say watchers3d agoMore tariffs, less red tape what Trump will mean for key global industries2d agoEU emissions fall by 8 in steep reduction reminiscent of Covid shutdown31 Oct 2024Sliver of cool surface water 2mm deep helps oceans absorb CO2, say scientists25 Oct 2024German carmakers shares slump on fear Trump will impose steep tariffs3d agoWe have emotions too Climate scientists respond to attacks on objectivity25 Oct 2024Trump or Harris?

The lawsuit came two years after a recordshattering heat dome killed 69 people across the county.Research shows the climate crisis greatly exacerbated the 2021 temperature surge. Oil and gas companies, which fuel global warming, should pay climate damages, the lawsuit argues.On Monday, the county announced that it has amended its complaint to include the gas utility NW Natural, Oregons oldest and largest fossil fuel company.NW Natural engaged in an enterprise of misrepresentation about the effects its products would have on the climate, the amended litigation says.NW Natural is responsible for some 9 of Oregons carbon dioxide emissions, the lawsuit alleges, arguing that it has also disseminated misinformation about the climate dangers of gas.Gas is primarily made of methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more planetheating than carbon dioxide.Big oil faces a rising number of climatefocused lawsuits, report findsRead moreThe countys move could open the door for more litigation against utilities, said Alyssa Johl, vicepresident of legal and general counsel at the Center for Climate Integrity, which tracks and supports climate deception lawsuits.Gas utilities have been significant players in the historic and ongoing deception campaigns to mislead the public about the dangers of fossil fuels, she said.Though NW Natural has touted its commitment to a carbon neutral future, the company has not implemented any operational changes that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Oregon, the lawsuit says. It also accuses the company of astroturfing community support for gas.NW Natural declined to comment, saying it had not yet reviewed the suit.Last month, a ProPublica investigation found that, despite public claims to be lowering its emissions, NW Natural has made little effort to achieve that goal.Lawmakers and advocates have for years urged the states department of justice to investigate the utility for false advertising.The amended complaint also names the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine  a nonprofit that environmentalists have long said spreads climate denial  marking the first such suit against the group.The original complaint was also the first to target the multinational consulting firm McKinsey  Company, which has long worked with big oil.Multnomah county is one of two dozen cities, counties and states across the US that have filed charges of climate deception against the fossil fuel industry. It seeks 50bn in damages from the 2021 heat dome and additional 1.5bn for future climate damages.Were already paying dearly in Multnomah County for our climate crisis  with our tax dollars, with our health and with our lives, the county chair, Jessica Vega, Pederson said in a statement. Going forward we have to strengthen our safety net just to keep people safe.Explore more on these topicsOregonBig oil uncoveredOil and gas companiesFossil fuelsOilCommoditiesLaw USClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionGreen lightNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints  correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms  conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top 2024 Guardian News  Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
